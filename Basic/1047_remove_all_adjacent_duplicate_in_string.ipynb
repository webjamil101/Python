    "\n",
    "### Approach 1: Using a Stack (Optimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept:** A stack (Last-In, First-Out) is perfect for this problem because we need to check the _most recently added_ character to see if it forms a duplicate pair with the current character. If they are duplicates, both are effectively removed. If not, the current character is added to the \"processed\" string, ready to be compared with the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Initialize an empty list (which will act as our stack).\n",
    "2.  Iterate through each character `char` in the input string `s`.\n",
    "3.  For each `char`:\n",
    "    - **Check if the stack is not empty AND the top element of the stack is equal to `char`:**\n",
    "      - If true, this means we've found an adjacent duplicate. Pop the top element from the stack (effectively removing both `char` and the top element).\n",
    "    - **Else (if the stack is empty OR the top element is different from `char`):**\n",
    "      - Push `char` onto the stack.\n",
    "4.  After iterating through all characters in `s`, the elements remaining in the stack, when joined together, form the final string.\n",

    "1.  Convert the input string `s` into a mutable list of characters (e.g., `char_list`).\n",

    "3.  Iterate with a `read_ptr` from `0` to `n-1` (where `n` is `s.length`).\n",
