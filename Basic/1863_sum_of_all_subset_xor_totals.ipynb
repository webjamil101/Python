    "# 1863. Sum of All Subset XOR Totals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty:** Easy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the XOR total of the array `[2,5,6]` is `2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array `nums`, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of `nums`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of Subset\n",
    "\n",
    "An array `a` is a subset of an array `b` if `a` can be obtained from `b` by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of `b`.\n",

    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nums = [1,3]\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "The 4 subsets of `[1,3]` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.\n",
    "- `[1]` has an XOR total of 1.\n",
    "- `[3]` has an XOR total of 3.\n",
    "- `[1,3]` has an XOR total of `1 XOR 3 = 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the sum of XOR totals is `0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6`.\n",

    "- `[1,6]` has an XOR total of `1 XOR 6 = 7`.\n",
    "- `[5,1,6]` has an XOR total of `5 XOR 1 XOR 6 = 2`.\n",

    "### Problem Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given an array `nums` and asked to find the sum of XOR totals for every subset of `nums`. The XOR total of a subset is computed by taking the XOR of all its elements, or `0` if the subset is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider all subsets of the input array `nums`.\n",
    "2. For each subset, compute the XOR total.\n",
    "3. Sum up the XOR totals of all subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subsets**: Every element of the array has two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - It can either be included in a subset.\n",
    "   - Or it can be excluded from a subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Hence, for an array of size `n`, there are `2^n` possible subsets, including the empty subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **XOR Operation**: For each subset, we need to compute the XOR of all its elements. XOR is a bitwise operation where:\n",
    "   - `a XOR a = 0`\n",
    "   - `a XOR 0 = a`\n",
    "   - XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order doesn't matter.\n",
    "3. **Subset Enumeration**: We can generate subsets using bitmasks. A bitmask of length `n` can represent whether each element of the array is included in the subset. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The bitmask `101` for an array `[a, b, c]` means the subset includes `a` and `c` but not `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Efficiency**: Given that the maximum length of the array is 12, there will be at most `2^12 = 4096` subsets, which is feasible for brute-force computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def subsetXORSum(nums):\n",
    "    n = len(nums)\n",
    "    total_sum = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    # There are 2^n subsets, represented by bitmasks from 0 to (2^n - 1)\n",
    "    for mask in range(1 << n):  # mask iterates from 0 to (2^n - 1)\n",
    "        xor_sum = 0\n",
    "        for i in range(n):\n",
    "            # Check if the i-th bit of mask is 1 (if the element nums[i] is in the subset)\n",
    "            if mask & (1 << i):\n",
    "                xor_sum ^= nums[i]\n",
    "        total_sum += xor_sum\n",
    "\n",
    "    return total_sum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bitmasking**:\n",
    "   - We iterate over all possible subsets using a bitmask from `0` to `2^n - 1`. The total number of subsets is `2^n`.\n",
    "   - For each `mask`, a bit is set to `1` if the corresponding element from `nums` is included in the subset.\n",
    "2. **XOR Calculation**:\n",
    "   - For each bitmask, we initialize `xor_sum` to `0` and then iterate over all elements of `nums`.\n",
    "   - For each element, if the corresponding bit in the bitmask is `1` (i.e., that element is part of the subset), we XOR that element with `xor_sum`.\n",
    "3. **Summing the XOR Totals**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After computing the XOR total for each subset, we add it to `total_sum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return**:\n",
    "   - Finally, we return the `total_sum`, which is the sum of XOR totals for all subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "For `nums = [1, 3]`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have 4 subsets: `[]`, `[1]`, `[3]`, and `[1, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Subset `[]`: XOR total = 0.\n",
    "  - Subset `[1]`: XOR total = 1.\n",
    "  - Subset `[3]`: XOR total = 3.\n",
    "  - Subset `[1, 3]`: XOR total = 1 XOR 3 = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The sum of these XOR totals is `0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have `2^n` subsets and for each subset, we need to calculate the XOR of the selected elements.\n",
    "- Each XOR computation involves iterating over `n` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the time complexity is `O(2^n * n)`, which is efficient enough for `n <= 12` as the maximum number of subsets is `4096`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Test case 1\n",
    "print(subsetXORSum([1, 3]))  # Output: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test case 2\n",
    "print(subsetXORSum([5, 1, 6]))  # Output: 28\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test case 3\n",
    "print(subsetXORSum([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]))  # Output: 480\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution efficiently calculates the sum of XOR totals for all subsets using bit manipulation and XOR operations.\n"
