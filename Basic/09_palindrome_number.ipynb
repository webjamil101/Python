    "### Problem Recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given an integer `x`, and we need to determine if it is a **palindrome number**. A **palindrome number** is a number that reads the same backward as forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `121` is a palindrome because it reads the same from left to right as from right to left.\n",
    "- `-121` is **not** a palindrome because the negative sign will not be at the end of the number when reversed.\n",
    "- `10` is **not** a palindrome because `01` is not the same as `10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can approach this problem in two common ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convert the number to a string and check if it reads the same forwards and backwards.**\n",
    "2. **Reverse half of the number and compare it with the other half.** (This method is more efficient and avoids using extra space.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on the second method because it's more efficient. Here's the explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handle Negative Numbers**:\n",
    "   - Any negative number is **not** a palindrome because, in a palindrome, the negative sign would appear at the end, which isn’t valid.\n",
    "2. **Handle Numbers with a Zero**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A number like `10` is not a palindrome because when reversed, it would become `01` (which is not equal to `10`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reverse the Second Half**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Instead of reversing the entire number, we can reverse only the second half of the number. If the first half is equal to the reversed second half, the number is a palindrome.\n",
    "   - We can do this by repeatedly dividing the number by 10 and extracting digits from the right end of the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stopping Condition**:\n",
    "   - We stop when the number becomes smaller than or equal to the reversed number. If the number is odd, we can simply ignore the middle digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Implementation in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def isPalindrome(x: int) -> bool:\n",
    "    # If x is negative or ends with a 0 but is not 0, it's not a palindrome\n",
    "    if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0):\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "\n",
    "    reversed_half = 0\n",
    "    while x > reversed_half:\n",
    "        reversed_half = reversed_half * 10 + x % 10  # Add the last digit of x to reversed_half\n",
    "        x //= 10  # Remove the last digit of x\n",
    "\n",
    "    # If x is equal to reversed_half or x equals reversed_half // 10 (to handle odd length numbers)\n",
    "    return x == reversed_half or x == reversed_half // 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Check for Negative and Zero Numbers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x != 0):\n",
    "       return False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If `x` is negative (`x < 0`), return `False` immediately because negative numbers cannot be palindromes.\n",
    "   - If `x` ends with a `0` but is not `0` itself (e.g., `10`), it cannot be a palindrome, so we return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reversing the Second Half**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   reversed_half = 0\n",
    "   while x > reversed_half:\n",
    "       reversed_half = reversed_half * 10 + x % 10  # Add the last digit of x to reversed_half\n",
    "       x //= 10  # Remove the last digit of x\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `reversed_half` stores the reversed digits of the second half of `x`.\n",
    "   - We keep extracting the last digit from `x` using `x % 10` and add it to `reversed_half`.\n",
    "   - Then, we reduce `x` by removing its last digit (`x //= 10`).\n",
    "   - The loop continues until `x` is smaller than or equal to `reversed_half`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Checking for Palindrome**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return x == reversed_half or x == reversed_half // 10\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - After the loop, if `x` equals `reversed_half`, then the number is a palindrome.\n",
    "   - If `x` has an odd number of digits, we can ignore the middle digit by comparing `x` with `reversed_half // 10` (integer division by 10).\n",
    "   - This ensures that for odd-length numbers, the middle digit doesn’t affect the palindrome check.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: O(log x), because in each iteration, we are dividing `x` by 10, which reduces the number of digits by one. The number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in the number.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we only use a constant amount of extra space to store `reversed_half`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input: 121**\n",
    "   - Initial `x = 121`, `reversed_half = 0`\n",
    "   - First iteration: `x = 12`, `reversed_half = 1`\n",
    "   - Second iteration: `x = 1`, `reversed_half = 12`\n",
    "   - Now, `x == reversed_half` (1 == 12), so it's a palindrome.\n",
    "2. **Input: -121**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Since `x` is negative, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Input: 10**\n",
    "   - Since `x % 10 == 0` and `x != 0`, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts:\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient, with a time complexity of O(log x), and avoids using extra space for converting the number to a string or an array. The main idea is to reverse only the second half of the number and compare it with the first half.\n"
