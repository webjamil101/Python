    "# 3477. Fruits Into Baskets II\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two arrays of integers, fruits and baskets, each of length n, where fruits[i] represents the quantity of the ith type of fruit, and baskets[j] represents the capacity of the jth basket.\n",
    "\n",
    "From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: fruits = [4,2,5], baskets = [3,5,4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- fruits[0] = 4 is placed in baskets[1] = 5.\n",
    "- fruits[1] = 2 is placed in baskets[0] = 3.\n",
    "- fruits[2] = 5 cannot be placed in baskets[2] = 4.\n",
    "- Since one fruit type remains unplaced, we return 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: fruits = [3,6,1], baskets = [6,4,7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- fruits[0] = 3 is placed in baskets[0] = 6.\n",
    "- fruits[1] = 6 cannot be placed in baskets[1] = 4 (insufficien capacity) but can be placed in the next available basket, baskets[2] = 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "- fruits[2] = 1 is placed in baskets[1] = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all fruits are successfully placed, we return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- n == fruits.length == baskets.length\n",
    "- 1 <= n <= 100\n",
    "- 1 <= fruits[i], baskets[i] <= 1000\n"

    "**Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Track Basket Availability:** We need a way to keep track of which baskets have been used. A boolean array, `is_basket_used`, of the same length as the `baskets` array, initialized to `False`, is a simple and effective way to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Count Unplaced Fruits:** Initialize a counter `unplaced_fruits` to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Iterate Through Fruits:** We'll use a loop to process each fruit type from left to right (from `i = 0` to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of fruit types).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Find a Basket for Each Fruit:** Inside the loop for fruits, we'll use a nested loop to iterate through the `baskets` from left to right (from `j = 0` to `n-1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For each basket, we check two conditions:\n",
    "      - `is_basket_used[j]` is `False`.\n",
    "      - `baskets[j]` has enough capacity for `fruits[i]` (i.e., `baskets[j] >= fruits[i]`).\n",
    "    - If both conditions are met, we've found a match. We mark this basket as used by setting `is_basket_used[j] = True`. We then break the inner loop to move on to the next fruit type, respecting the \"leftmost\" rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Handle Unplaced Fruits:** If the inner loop completes without finding a suitable basket (we can use a flag variable for this), it means the current fruit type `fruits[i]` cannot be placed. In this case, we increment `unplaced_fruits`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Return Result:** After the outer loop has processed all fruit types, `unplaced_fruits` will hold the final count.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(N^2), where N is the length of the `fruits` and `baskets` arrays. This comes from the nested loops: for each of the `N` fruit types, we may iterate through all `N` baskets. Since N is at most 100, this is a very efficient and acceptable solution.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store the `is_basket_used` boolean array.\n"
