    "For the problem \"Find the K-th Character in String Game I\", we need to determine the character at a specific index `k` after a series of string transformations. The string starts with \"a\", and in each step, a new string is generated by shifting each character of the current `word` to its next character in the alphabet (with 'z' wrapping to 'a'), and this new string is appended to the `word`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Initial:** `word = \"a\"`, length = 1\n",
    "- **1st operation:**\n",

    "  - Shifted \"a\" is \"b\".\n",
    "  - `word` becomes \"ab\". Length = 2.\n",
    "- **2nd operation:**\n",

    "**Complexity Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** In each step, the string length doubles. Let `L` be the final length of the string (which is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `k`). The number of operations will be approximately $\\\\log\\_2 k$. In each operation, we iterate through the current string to build the new part, which takes `O(current_length)` time. So, the total time complexity will be $O(L)$, which is roughly $O(k)$. Given $k \\\\le 500$, $L \\\\le 512$, this approach is very efficient.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** We are storing the `word` string, which can grow up to `L` characters. So, the space complexity is $O(L)$, which is roughly $O(k)$.\n",

    "If `k` is in the second half of `S_n` (i.e., `k > len(S_{n-1})`), then the `k`-th character of `S_n` is the `(k - len(S_{n-1}))`-th character of `shift(S_{n-1})`. This means it's the next character in the alphabet of the `(k - len(S_{n-1}))`-th character of `S_{n-1}`.\n",

    "**OOP Design Choices and Rationale:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`KthCharacterFinder` Class:** This class is designed to find the character without storing the entire string. It's stateless regarding the `word` itself.\n",
    "- **`__init__`:** Empty, as this approach doesn't maintain a growing `word` state.\n",
    "- **`_get_shifted_char` (Private Helper):** Encapsulates the logic for character shifting. This makes the `find_kth_character` method cleaner and separates concerns.\n",
    "- **`find_kth_character` (Public Interface):** This method takes `k` and calculates the result directly using the observed pattern. It doesn't modify any internal state that persists across calls (other than local variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which OOP approach is better for this specific problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the given constraint `1 <= k <= 500`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OOP Approach 1 (Direct Simulation)** is arguably _more appropriate_ and easier to understand. The $O(k)$ time complexity and $O(k)$ space complexity are well within limits for $k=500$. It directly models the problem statement.\n",
    "- **OOP Approach 2 (Recursive Logic)** is an _over-optimization_ for this specific constraint but demonstrates a more robust and scalable solution for much larger `k` values (e.g., $k=10^{18}$), where direct simulation would be infeasible due to memory and time constraints. Its $O(\\\\log k)$ time and $O(1)$ space complexity are superior asymptotically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are valid OOP implementations, but the simulation one aligns more directly with the \"game\" description for the given `k` range.\n"
