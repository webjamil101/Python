    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Encrypt the string using the following algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each character `c` in `s`, replace `c` with the `k`th character after `c` in the string (in a cyclic manner).\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the encrypted string.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Input**:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Breakdown of the `getEncryptedString` Method in the Given Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through the algorithm in the code to understand its logic step by step and identify the issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Review:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def getEncryptedString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n",
    "        n = len(s)  # Get the length of the string\n",
    "        k = k % n  # Normalize k to avoid redundant shifts (k > n)\n",
    "        result = \"\"  # Initialize an empty result string\n",
    "        for i in range(n):  # Iterate through each character in the string\n",
    "            res += s[(i + k) % n]  # Append shifted characters to 'res'\n",
    "        return result  # Return the final encrypted string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normalize `k`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   k = k % n\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This line ensures that the number of shifts `k` is within the bounds of the string's length (`n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For example, if `k = 27` and the string's length is `n = 26`, then `k % 26` will be `1`, effectively shifting the string by 1 position.\n",
    "   - If `k` is greater than the length of the string, this reduces the redundant shifts and ensures that we don't perform unnecessary cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop through the string**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(n):\n",
    "       res += s[(i + k) % n]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here, the algorithm tries to append the new characters (shifted by `k` positions) to the result string. It does so by calculating the new index `(i + k) % n` for each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `(i + k) % n` ensures that we get a valid index within the bounds of the string. If the index exceeds `n - 1`, it wraps around cyclically back to the beginning of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Issue:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In the code, the `res` variable is used inside the loop, but it is not defined before the loop. Instead, the `result` variable is initialized before the loop, but the loop is appending to `res` instead of `result`.\n",
    "   - This will result in an `UnboundLocalError` since the `res` variable is being used without being initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return the result**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return result\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The final result is returned after the loop completes, which should be the encrypted string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixing the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue is the undefined variable `res`. The variable `result` should be used instead of `res`. Here's the corrected version of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def getEncryptedString(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n",
    "        n = len(s)  # Get the length of the string\n",
    "        k = k % n  # Normalize k to avoid redundant shifts (k > n)\n",
    "        result = \"\"  # Initialize an empty result string\n",
    "        for i in range(n):  # Iterate through each character in the string\n",
    "            result += s[(i + k) % n]  # Append shifted characters to 'result'\n",
    "        return result  # Return the final encrypted string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Corrected Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization of `k`** ensures that the number of shifts is within the bounds of the string length.\n",
    "- **Cyclic shifting** is done by `(i + k) % n` to handle wrapping around the string when necessary.\n",
    "- The corrected code appends the shifted characters to the `result` variable instead of the undefined `res`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"dart\"\n",
    "k = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String Length**: `n = 4`\n",
    "- **Normalized `k`**: `k = 3 % 4 = 3` (no change, as `k` is already smaller than `n`)\n",
    "- **Iteration**:\n",
    "  - For `i = 0`: `(0 + 3) % 4 = 3` → `result += s[3] = 't'`\n",
    "  - For `i = 1`: `(1 + 3) % 4 = 0` → `result += s[0] = 'd'`\n",
    "  - For `i = 2`: `(2 + 3) % 4 = 1` → `result += s[1] = 'a'`\n",
    "  - For `i = 3`: `(3 + 3) % 4 = 2` → `result += s[2] = 'r'`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final result**: `\"tdar\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = \"aaa\"\n",
    "k = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String Length**: `n = 3`\n",
    "- **Normalized `k`**: `k = 1 % 3 = 1`\n",
    "- **Iteration**:\n",
    "  - For `i = 0`: `(0 + 1) % 3 = 1` → `result += s[1] = 'a'`\n",
    "  - For `i = 1`: `(1 + 1) % 3 = 2` → `result += s[2] = 'a'`\n",
    "  - For `i = 2`: `(2 + 1) % 3 = 0` → `result += s[0] = 'a'`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final result**: `\"aaa\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We loop through each character exactly once and perform constant-time operations for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We store the result in a string which has the same length as the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by cyclically shifting the string's characters by `k` positions, and the corrected code handles this with proper variable usage and logic.\n"
