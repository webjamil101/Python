    "\n",
    "\t\ta.We need to check if it's possible to plant a flower there. A flower can be planted in a plot flowerbed[i] if it's empty and both its left and right neighbors are also empty.\n",

    "2. Handle Boundaries: The \"neighbors\" check needs to handle the edge cases for the first and last plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\ta.The left neighbor of flowerbed[i] is considered empty if i is the first plot (i == 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "\tb.The right neighbor of flowerbed[i] is considered empty if i is the last plot (i == len(flowerbed) - 1).\n",

    "\n",
    "\ta.We \"plant\" a flower by changing flowerbed[i] to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tb.We decrement n (the number of flowers to be planted) by 1.\n",

    "4. Early Exit: If at any point n becomes 0 or less, it means we have successfully planted all the required flowers, and we can immediately return True.\n",
