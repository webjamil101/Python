We can group the array based on whether each number is odd or even. Then, we can check if any of the groups of odd numbers have a length of 3 or more.\n",

The `key` function (`lambda x: x % 2 != 0`) returns `True` if the number `x` is odd and `False` if it's even. So, consecutive odd numbers will be in one group, and consecutive even numbers will be in another.\n",

    "- The **counter** approach is also efficient and can be very clear in its logic of tracking consecutive occurrences.\n",

    "For this particular problem, the basic loop and the counter approach are likely the most performant and readable. However, the `groupby` approach showcases a useful Python tool for other sequence processing tasks. The sliding window approach, while valid, doesn't offer a significant advantage over the basic loop in this case.\n"
