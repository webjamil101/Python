    "### Approach 2: Two-Pointer Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach avoids creating new, large strings. Instead, it compares the characters from both arrays one by one, effectively \"streaming\" through the data. This is particularly useful if the concatenated strings could be very large and memory is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "#**Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Initialize two sets of pointers:\n",
    "    - `p1` and `p2`: The current word indices for `word1` and `word2`.\n",
    "    - `c1` and `c2`: The current character indices within `word1[p1]` and `word2[p2]`.\n",
    "2.  Enter a `while` loop that continues as long as both word indices are within the bounds of their respective arrays (`p1 < len(word1)` and `p2 < len(word2)`).\n",
    "3.  Inside the loop, compare `word1[p1][c1]` and `word2[p2][c2]`. If they are not equal, the strings are not equivalent, so return `False`.\n",
    "4.  If the characters are equal, we advance the character pointers.\n",
    "    - Increment `c1`. If `c1` reaches the end of the current word `word1[p1]`, reset `c1` to 0 and advance the word pointer `p1`.\n",
    "    - Do the same for `c2` and `p2`.\n",
    "5.  After the loop, the strings are only equivalent if both word pointers have reached the end of their arrays. We return `p1 == len(word1)` and `p2 == len(word2)`. This handles cases where one array is a prefix of the other (e.g., `[\"a\"]` vs `[\"a\", \"b\"]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(min(L1, L2)). The loop runs for as long as the characters match, up to the total length of the shorter concatenated string.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a few integer pointers and do not allocate any new strings.\n"
