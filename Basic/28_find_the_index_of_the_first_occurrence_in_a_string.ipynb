    "## 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty:** Easy  \n",
    "**Topics:** String Manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the **first occurrence** of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "haystack = \"sadbutsad\", needle = \"sad\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "\"sad\" occurs at index 0 and 6. The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "haystack = \"leetcode\", needle = \"leeto\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "-1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "\"leeto\" did not occur in \"leetcode\", so we return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4`\n",
    "- `haystack` and `needle` consist of only lowercase English characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can solve this problem using Python's built-in method `find()` which returns the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def strStr(haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:\n",
    "    return haystack.find(needle)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `find()` method searches for the substring `needle` in the string `haystack`.\n",
    "- If `needle` is found, `find()` returns the index of its first occurrence.\n",
    "- If `needle` is not found, `find()` returns `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(strStr(\"sadbutsad\", \"sad\"))  # Output: 0\n",
    "print(strStr(\"leetcode\", \"leeto\")) # Output: -1\n",
    "```\n"
