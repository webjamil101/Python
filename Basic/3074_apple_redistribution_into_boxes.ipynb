    "\n",
    "Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: apple = [1,3,2], capacity = [4,3,1,5,2]\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** We will use boxes with capacities 4 and 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to distribute the apples as the total capacity is greater than or equal to the total number of apples.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "Input: apple = [5,5,5], capacity = [2,4,2,7]\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
