    "### Algorithm: Brute-Force Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem asks us to consider _all possible ways_ of splitting the string into two non-empty substrings, calculate the score for each split, and then find the maximum among them. This is exactly what a brute-force approach does.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea:** The split point can be at any position in the string, as long as it results in two non-empty substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialize `max_score = 0`:** This variable will store the highest score found so far. It's safe to initialize to 0 because the minimum possible score is 0 (e.g., splitting \"10\" into \"1\" and \"0\" yields 0 zeros + 0 ones = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Iterate Through All Possible Split Points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A string `s` of length `N` can be split at `N-1` possible points.\n",
    "    - If `s` is \"ABCDE\", the possible splits are:\n",
    "      - \"A\" | \"BCDE\" (split after index 0)\n",
    "      - \"AB\" | \"CDE\" (split after index 1)\n",
    "      - \"ABC\" | \"DE\" (split after index 2)\n",
    "      - \"ABCD\" | \"E\" (split after index 3)\n",
    "    - So, the split point (the index _after_ which the string is split) will range from `1` up to `len(s) - 1`.\n",
    "    - In a loop, let's call this split point `i`. `i` will be the starting index of the _right_ substring.\n",
    "    - The `left_substring` will be `s[0:i]`.\n",
    "    - The `right_substring` will be `s[i:len(s)]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **For each split point `i`:**\n",

    "    - **Calculate Zeros in Left Substring:**\n",
    "      - Iterate through `left_substring` and count the number of '0's. Let's call this `zeros_left`.\n",
    "    - **Calculate Ones in Right Substring:**\n",

    "  - Counting '0's and '1's in these substrings (`.count()` method or manual iteration) also takes $O(N)$ time in the worst case (as the substrings can be almost `N` characters long).\n",
    "  - Therefore, the total time complexity is roughly $(N-1) \\\\times (O(N) + O(N)) = O(N^2)$.\n",
    "  - Given `N <= 500`, $N^2$ would be $250,000$, which is acceptable within typical time limits (usually $10^8$ operations per second).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In each iteration, we create `left_substring` and `right_substring` by slicing. These new strings can take up to $O(N)$ space. Although they are temporary and get garbage collected, at any given point, `O(N)` space is used for these copies.\n",
