    "# 1496. Path Crossing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string path, where path[i] = 'N', 'S', 'E' or 'W', each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin (0, 0) on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return true if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: path = \"NES\"\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **2D Grid Traversal:** We're moving on a 2D plane.\n",
    "  * **Coordinates:** A point can be represented by its (x, y) coordinates.\n",
    "  * **Previously Visited:** We need a way to store and quickly check if a coordinate has been visited before.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `1 <= path.length <= 10^4`: The path can be up to 10,000 moves long. This means an $O(N)$ or $O(N \\\\log N)$ solution is desirable. An $O(N^2)$ solution would likely be too slow.\n",
    "  * `path[i]` is 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: `path = \"NES\"`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Start: `(0, 0)`\n",
    "  * `N`: Move North to `(0, 1)`\n",
    "  * `E`: Move East to `(1, 1)`\n",
    "  * `S`: Move South to `(1, 0)`\n",
    "  * All visited points are `(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0)`. No repeats. Output: `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2: `path = \"NESWW\"`**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Start: `(0, 0)`\n",
    "  * `N`: Move North to `(0, 1)`\n",
    "  * `E`: Move East to `(1, 1)`\n",
    "  * `S`: Move South to `(1, 0)`\n",
    "  * `W`: Move West to `(0, 0)`. **Aha\\!** `(0, 0)` was visited at the start. Path crosses itself. Output: `true`.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Approach: Hash Set to Track Visited Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most straightforward and efficient approach. We can use a hash set (Python's `set`) to store all the coordinates visited so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Initialize current coordinates `x = 0`, `y = 0`.\n",
    "2.  Create an empty hash set called `visited`.\n",
    "3.  Add the starting point `(0, 0)` to `visited`.\n",
    "4.  Iterate through each character `move` in the `path` string:\n",
    "    a.  Update `x` and `y` based on the `move`:\n",
    "    \\* If `move == 'N'`, `y += 1`\n",
    "    \\* If `move == 'S'`, `y -= 1`\n",
    "    \\* If `move == 'E'`, `x += 1`\n",
    "    \\* If `move == 'W'`, `x -= 1`\n",
    "    b.  Form the `current_location = (x, y)`.\n",
    "    c.  **Check for crossing:** If `current_location` is already in `visited`, it means we've been here before. Return `true`.\n",
    "    d.  If `current_location` is not in `visited`, add it to `visited` to mark it as seen.\n",
    "5.  If the loop completes without finding any cross, return `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this works:**\n",
    "A hash set provides $O(1)$ average-case time complexity for `add` and `in` (membership test) operations. This allows us to quickly check if a location has been visited without iterating through a list of all visited points each time. Since we check *before* adding the current point, we correctly detect if the current move lands us on an already visited spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "-\n",
    "\n",
    "## Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Time Complexity:** $O(L)$, where `L` is the length of the `path` string.\n",
    "\n",
    "      * We iterate through the `path` string once.\n",
    "      * Inside the loop, updating coordinates is $O(1)$.\n",
    "      * Set operations (`add`, `in`) are $O(1)$ on average.\n",
    "      * Therefore, the total time complexity is linear with respect to the path length.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Space Complexity:** $O(L)$, where `L` is the length of the `path` string.\n",
    "\n",
    "      * In the worst case (a path that never crosses itself), the `visited` set will store `L + 1` unique coordinates (including the origin).\n",
    "      * Each coordinate tuple `(x, y)` takes constant space.\n",
    "      * Therefore, the total space complexity is linear with respect to the path length.\n",
