    "The problem \"Minimum Distance to the Target Element\" (LeetCode 1848) in Python is quite straightforward due to Python's flexibility. We're looking for an index `i` where `nums[i] == target` and `abs(i - start)` is minimized. The `target` is guaranteed to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the possible approaches in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 1: Linear Scan (Iterating and Tracking Minimum)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common and generally recommended approach. You iterate through the array from beginning to end. Whenever you find the `target` element, you calculate its absolute distance from `start` and update a variable that keeps track of the minimum distance found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Initialize `min_dist` to `float('inf')` (Python's representation for positive infinity), ensuring that any valid distance will be smaller.\n",
    "2.  Iterate through the `nums` array using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the value `num` at that index.\n",
    "3.  Inside the loop, check if `num == target`.\n",
    "4.  If it is, calculate `current_dist = abs(i - start)`.\n",
    "5.  Update `min_dist = min(min_dist, current_dist)`.\n",
    "6.  After the loop finishes, `min_dist` will hold the smallest absolute distance found. Return `min_dist`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, where $N$ is the length of `nums`, because we iterate through the array once.\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as we only use a few variables for storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def getMinDistance(self, nums: list[int], target: int, start: int) -> int:\n",
    "        min_dist = float('inf') # Initialize with a very large number\n",
    "\n",
    "        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n",
    "            if num == target:\n",
    "                current_dist = abs(i - start)\n",
    "                min_dist = min(min_dist, current_dist)\n",
    "\n",
    "        return min_dist\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2: List Comprehension with `min()`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a more Pythonic and concise way to achieve the same result as the linear scan. It leverages list comprehensions to generate all possible distances and then uses the built-in `min()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Use a list comprehension to create a list of `abs(i - start)` for every `i` where `nums[i] == target`.\n",
    "2.  Use the `min()` function on this generated list to find the smallest distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, as the list comprehension still iterates through the entire array.\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** $O(K)$, where $K$ is the number of occurrences of `target` in `nums`. In the worst case (e.g., if all elements are `target`), $K$ can be $N$, so it's $O(N)$ in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def getMinDistance(self, nums: list[int], target: int, start: int) -> int:\n",
    "        # Generate a list of distances for all occurrences of target\n",
    "        distances = [abs(i - start) for i, num in enumerate(nums) if num == target]\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Return the minimum distance from the generated list\n",
    "        return min(distances)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 3: Two-Pointer / Expanding Search (Less Common for this problem due to small constraints)\n",
    "\n",
    "While not strictly necessary for optimal Big O performance on this problem (as N is small, and a simple linear scan is already O(N)), you could theoretically consider an expanding search from the `start` index. This might be conceptually faster if the `target` is guaranteed to be _very_ close to `start`, but for general cases, it adds complexity without improving the asymptotic complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm (Conceptual):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Initialize `left = start` and `right = start`.\n",
    "2.  Loop:\n",
    "    a. Check `nums[start]` first. If it's `target`, return `0`.\n",
    "    b. Check `nums[left]` (if `left` is within bounds). If it's `target`, return `abs(left - start)`.\n",
    "    c. Check `nums[right]` (if `right` is within bounds). If it's `target`, return `abs(right - start)`.\n",
    "    d. Decrement `left`, increment `right`.\n",
    "    e. The loop would terminate because `target` is guaranteed to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** $O(N)$ in the worst case (e.g., `target` is at `nums[0]` and `start` is at `nums[N-1]`, or vice versa).\n",

    "```\n",
