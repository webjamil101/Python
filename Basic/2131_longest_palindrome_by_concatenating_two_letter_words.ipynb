    "## Problem Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A palindrome reads the same forwards and backward. When concatenating two-letter words, we need to consider how they contribute to forming a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of two-letter words:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Words that are palindromes themselves (e.g., \"gg\", \"cc\", \"aa\")**: These words have the form `xx`.\n",
    "2.  **Words that are not palindromes (e.g., \"lc\", \"cl\", \"ab\", \"ba\")**: These words have the form `xy` where `x != y`. For `xy` to contribute to a larger palindrome, it _must_ be paired with its reverse, `yx`. For example, `lc` needs `cl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A long palindrome is typically formed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A central part (which can be a single word that is a palindrome itself, like \"gg\").\n",
    "- Pairs of words that are reverses of each other, forming a structure like `word1 + word2 + ... + reverse(word2) + reverse(word1)`. For example, \"ab\" + \"cd\" + \"dc\" + \"ba\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, if we use a word `xy` and its reverse `yx`, they contribute 4 to the total length. If we use a word `xx` and another `xx`, they contribute 4 to the total length. If we use a single `xx` word as the central part, it contributes 2 to the total length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a frequency map (hash map or dictionary) to count the occurrences of each word. This will be central to all approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1: Using a Hash Map (Frequency Counter)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most intuitive and efficient approach. We'll count the frequency of each word and then intelligently pair them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Count Frequencies:** Create a hash map (dictionary in Python) to store the frequency of each word in the input `words` array.\n",
    "2.  **Initialize `longest_palindrome_length`:** Set this to 0.\n",
    "3.  **Initialize `has_odd_palindrome_center`:** Set this to `False`. This flag tracks if we've used a single palindrome word (like \"gg\") as the center of our overall palindrome. A palindrome can have at most one such central word.\n",
    "4.  **Iterate through Frequencies:** Iterate through the words and their counts in the frequency map.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Case A: Word is a palindrome (e.g., \"gg\", \"cc\")**:\n",
    "      - Let `word` be `xx`.\n",
    "      - If `count` of `xx` is even (e.g., \"gg\" appears 2 or 4 times): Add `count * 2` to `longest_palindrome_length`. All `xx` words can be paired up (e.g., \"gg\" + \"gg\").\n",
    "      - If `count` of `xx` is odd (e.g., \"gg\" appears 1, 3, or 5 times): Add `(count - 1) * 2` to `longest_palindrome_length`. This accounts for all but one `xx` word, which can be paired. The remaining single `xx` word can potentially be the center of the total palindrome. Set `has_odd_palindrome_center = True`.\n",
    "    - **Case B: Word is NOT a palindrome (e.g., \"lc\", \"ab\")**:\n",
    "      - Let `word` be `xy`. Its reverse is `yx`.\n",
    "      - Check if `yx` exists in the frequency map.\n",
    "      - If `yx` exists:\n",
    "        - Determine the number of pairs we can form: `num_pairs = min(freq[word], freq[reverse_word])`.\n",
    "        - Add `num_pairs * 4` to `longest_palindrome_length` (each pair `xy` + `yx` contributes 4 to the length).\n",
    "        - Mark both `word` and `reverse_word` as \"used\" or set their frequencies to 0 in the map (or simply ensure we don't process `yx` when we iterate to it later). A simple way to avoid double-counting is to remove `reverse_word` from the map or set its frequency to 0 after processing `word`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Final Check for Central Palindrome:** If `has_odd_palindrome_center` is `True`, add 2 to `longest_palindrome_length`. This accounts for the single middle word like \"gg\" that we reserved.\n",
