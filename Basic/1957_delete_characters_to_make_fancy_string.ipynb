    "        Algorithm: Iterate and Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "        The problem defines a \"fancy\" string as one where no three consecutive characters are the same.\n",
    "        This means a sequence like \"aaa\" is forbidden. We aim to build the shortest possible string\n",
    "        that adheres to this rule by deleting the minimum number of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The strategy is to iterate through the input string `s` character by character.\n",
    "        We maintain a `fancy_chars` list (which will eventually be joined to form the result string).\n",
    "        For each character from `s`, we decide whether to append it to `fancy_chars` based on\n",
    "        whether it would violate the \"no three consecutive\" rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Steps:\n",
    "        1. Initialize an empty list `fancy_chars`. This list will accumulate the characters\n",
    "           of the fancy string. Using a list for appending is efficient in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. Iterate through each `char` in the input string `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. For each `char`, check if appending it would create three consecutive identical characters:\n",
    "           - The condition for this violation is:\n",
    "             a. `fancy_chars` must already contain at least two characters (`len(fancy_chars) >= 2`).\n",
    "             b. The last character in `fancy_chars` (`fancy_chars[-1]`) must be the same as `char`.\n",
    "             c. The second-to-last character in `fancy_chars` (`fancy_chars[-2]`) must also be the same as `char`.\n",
    "\n",
    "           - If all three conditions (a, b, and c) are true, it means `fancy_chars` currently ends\n",
    "             with `X, X` and the `current char` is `X`. Appending `char` would result in `X, X, X`.\n",
    "             According to the rule \"no three consecutive characters are the same\", this `char` must be skipped\n",
    "             (effectively deleted) to maintain the fancy property.\n",
    "\n",
    "           - Otherwise (if the conditions for violation are not met), appending `char` is safe.\n",
    "             Append `char` to `fancy_chars`.\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. After iterating through all characters in `s`, join the `fancy_chars` list into a single string\n",
    "           and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`.\n",
    "                         We iterate through the string once. List appends and accesses\n",
    "                         (like `[-1]`, `[-2]`) are O(1) operations.\n",
    "        Space Complexity: O(N) in the worst case, if no characters are deleted (e.g., \"abcde\").\n",
    "                          In the best case, it could be O(1) if the string shrinks significantly (e.g., \"aaaaa\" -> \"aa\").\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        fancy_chars = []\n",
    "\n",
    "        for char in s:\n",
    "            # Check if appending 'char' would create three consecutive identical characters.\n",
    "            # This happens if the last two characters in fancy_chars are already 'char'.\n",
    "            if len(fancy_chars) >= 2 and \\\n",
    "               fancy_chars[-1] == char and \\\n",
    "               fancy_chars[-2] == char:\n",
