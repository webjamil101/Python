    "You are given a directed, weighted graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] represents a directed edge from node ui to node vi with cost wi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node ui has a switch that can be used at most once: when you arrive at ui and have not yet used its switch, you may activate it on one of its incoming edges vi → ui reverse that edge to ui → vi and immediately traverse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reversal is only valid for that single move, and using a reversed edge costs 2 \\* wi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum total cost to travel from node 0 to node n - 1. If it is not possible, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the path 0 → 1 (cost 3).\n",
    "- At node 1 reverse the original edge 3 → 1 into 1 → 3 and traverse it at cost 2 \\* 1 = 2.\n",
    "- Total cost is 3 + 2 = 5.\n",

    "Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,2,1],[2,1,1],[1,3,1],[2,3,3]]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- No reversal is needed. Take the path 0 → 2 (cost 1), then 2 → 1 (cost 1), then 1 → 3 (cost 1).\n",
