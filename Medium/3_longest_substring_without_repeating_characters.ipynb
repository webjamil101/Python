    "# LeetCode Problem 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string s, we need to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Example:_\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: \"abcabcbb\"\n",
    "- Output: 3 (\"abc\" is the longest substring without repeating characters)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the _sliding window_ technique with a hash set to track characters in the current window. The idea is to maintain a window of characters that haven't been seen before, expanding the window when we see new characters and shrinking it when we encounter duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize two pointers (left and right) at the start of the string\n",
    "2. Use a set to keep track of unique characters in the current window\n",
    "3. Move the right pointer forward:\n",
    "   - If the character isn't in the set, add it and update max length\n",
    "   - If it is in the set, move the left pointer forward, removing characters from the set until the duplicate is removed\n",
    "4. Continue until the right pointer reaches the end of the string\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:\n",
    "char_set = set()\n",
    "left = 0\n",
    "max_length = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    for right in range(len(s)):\n",
    "        while s[right] in char_set:\n",
    "            char_set.remove(s[left])\n",
    "            left += 1\n",
    "        char_set.add(s[right])\n",
    "        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return max_length\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- _char_set_: Tracks characters in the current window\n",
    "- _left_: Marks the start of the current window\n",
    "- _right_: Expands the window by moving forward\n",
    "- When we encounter a duplicate (s[right] in char_set), we remove characters from the left until the duplicate is removed\n",
    "- We calculate the window size as right - left + 1 and keep track of the maximum size found\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach runs in O(n) time (each character is visited at most twice) and O(min(m, n)) space where m is the character set size (for the hash set).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative Optimized Solution (using dictionary for faster lookups)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:\n",
    "char_map = {} # stores the most recent index of each character\n",
    "left = 0\n",
    "max_length = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    for right in range(len(s)):\n",
    "        if s[right] in char_map:\n",
    "            # Move left to max of its current position or right after the last occurrence\n",
    "            left = max(left, char_map[s[right]] + 1)\n",
    "        char_map[s[right]] = right  # update the last seen index\n",
    "        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return max_length\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This optimized version uses a dictionary to store the last seen index of each character, allowing us to jump the left pointer directly to the right of the duplicate character when found, rather than moving it one by one.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. _Class Structure_:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Created two separate classes for each approach to demonstrate different implementations\n",
    "   - Each class has a single public method length_of_longest_substring\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _Edge Cases Handled_:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Empty string (\"\")\n",
    "   - Single character string (\" \", \"a\")\n",
    "   - All repeating characters (\"bbbbb\")\n",
    "   - Entire string is unique (\"au\")\n",
    "   - Cases requiring proper left pointer adjustment (\"dvdf\", \"abba\")\n",
    "\n",
    "3. _Testing_:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Used Python's unittest framework\n",
    "   - Created comprehensive test cases covering all edge cases\n",
    "   - Tested both implementations with the same test cases\n",
    "   - Used subTest to identify which specific test case fails\n",
    "\n",
    "4. _Benefits of OOP Approach_:\n",
    "   - Encapsulation: Implementation details are hidden within classes\n",
    "   - Reusability: Can easily switch between implementations\n",
    "   - Testability: Easy to write unit tests for each approach\n",
    "   - Extensibility: Can easily add new approaches by creating new classes\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, simply execute the Python file. Both implementations should pass all test cases, demonstrating they work correctly for all scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OOP approach makes the code more organized, maintainable, and easier to test compared to a purely procedural implementation.\n"

    "**Explanation of the Optimized Sliding Window with Dictionary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`SubstringFinderDict` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Encapsulates the logic for finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters using a dictionary.\n",
    "    - The `length_of_longest_substring` method implements the optimized sliding window approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Optimized Sliding Window Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `char_map`: A dictionary to store the last seen index of each character encountered in the string.\n",
    "    - `left`: The left pointer of the sliding window, initialized to 0.\n",
    "    - `max_length`: Stores the maximum length found so far, initialized to 0.\n",
    "    - The `for` loop iterates through the string with the `right` pointer.\n",
    "    - **Handling Repeating Characters:**\n",
    "      - `current_char = s[right]`: Gets the current character being processed.\n",
    "      - `if current_char in char_map:`: Checks if the current character has been seen before.\n",
    "      - `left = max(left, char_map[current_char] + 1)`: This is the optimization. If the current character is in the `char_map`, it means we have a repetition. Instead of iteratively moving the `left` pointer as in the set-based approach, we directly update the `left` pointer to be one position after the last seen index of the repeating character. We use `max(left, ...)` to ensure that the `left` pointer only moves forward and doesn't go back if the last seen index was before the current `left`.\n",
    "    - **Updating the Character Map:**\n",
    "      - `char_map[current_char] = right`: We update the `char_map` with the current character and its current index (`right`). This ensures we always have the latest seen index.\n",
    "    - **Updating Maximum Length:**\n",
    "      - `max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)`: We update `max_length` with the maximum of the current `max_length` and the current window length (`right - left + 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **`TestSubstringFinderDict` Class:**\n",
    "    - Uses the `unittest` framework for testing.\n",
    "    - `setUp(self)`: Initializes the `SubstringFinderDict` object and defines a comprehensive list of `test_cases` (identical to the set-based approach for thorough comparison).\n",
    "    - `test_longest_substring(self)`: Iterates through the `test_cases` and uses `self.assertEqual` to assert that the output of the `length_of_longest_substring` method matches the `expected` result for each input string `s`.\n",
    "    - `self.subTest(s=s)`: Provides more informative output during test execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Optimization with Dictionary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary-based approach is more efficient because when a repeating character is found, we can directly jump the `left` pointer to the position after the previous occurrence of that character. In the set-based approach, we might have to move the `left` pointer one step at a time, removing characters from the set until the repeating character is no longer in the window. This direct jump in the dictionary approach avoids unnecessary iterations, leading to better performance, especially for strings with many repetitions. The time complexity of both approaches is still O(n) in the worst case, but the dictionary approach generally has a better constant factor.\n"
