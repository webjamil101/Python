    "## 438. Find All Anagrams in a String\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solved** | Medium | Topics | Companies\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in any order.\n",

    "The substring with start index = 0 is \"cba\", which is an anagram of \"abc\".\n",
    "The substring with start index = 6 is \"bac\", which is an anagram of \"abc\".\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explanation of the Python Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `n`: Length of the string `s`.\n",
    "    - `m`: Length of the pattern `p`.\n",
    "    - If `m` is greater than `n`, no anagrams can exist, so an empty list is returned.\n",
    "    - `p_count`: A `Counter` to store the frequency of each character in the pattern `p`.\n",
    "    - `s_count`: A `Counter` to store the frequency of characters in the current sliding window of `s`.\n",
    "    - `result`: An empty list to store the starting indices of the anagrams found.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Sliding Window:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The code iterates through the string `s` using a sliding window of size `m` (the length of `p`).\n",
    "    - **Expanding the Window:** In each iteration `i`, the current character `s[i]` is added to the `s_count`.\n",
    "    - **Shrinking the Window:** If the window size (`i + 1`) exceeds `m`, the leftmost character of the window (`s[i - m]`) is removed from `s_count`. If the count of this character becomes 0, it's removed from the `s_count` to keep it clean.\n",
    "    - **Anagram Check:** After each window update, the `s_count` is compared with `p_count`. If they are equal, it means the current window in `s` is an anagram of `p`, and the starting index of this window (`i - m + 1`) is appended to the `result` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Return Result:**\n",
    "    - Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing all the starting indices of the anagrams of `p` found in `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through `s` once. The operations on the `Counter` take constant time on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** O(m), where m is the length of the pattern `p`. The `p_count` and `s_count` Counters will store at most the number of unique characters in `p`. In the worst case (all characters in `p` are unique), the space complexity would be O(m).\n"

    "**Explanation of Each Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Sliding Window with Character Count (Optimized):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea:** This is the most efficient approach. It uses a sliding window of the same size as the pattern `p` over the string `s`. It maintains a count of characters within the current window and compares it with the character count of `p`. The window slides one character at a time, efficiently updating the character counts.\n",
    "- **Steps:**\n",
    "  1.  Count the frequency of each character in `p`.\n",
    "  2.  Initialize a window of the same size as `p` in `s` and count the frequency of its characters.\n",
    "  3.  If the character counts match, add the starting index of the window to the result.\n",
    "  4.  Slide the window one character to the right:\n",
    "      - Decrement the count of the character that is leaving the window from the left.\n",
    "      - Increment the count of the character that is entering the window from the right.\n",
    "  5.  After each slide, compare the window's character counts with the pattern's character counts. If they match, add the starting index of the current window to the result.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of `s`.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(m), where m is the length of `p` (for storing character counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Brute Force (Generating and Comparing):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea:** Generate all possible substrings of `s` that have the same length as `p`. For each substring, check if it's an anagram of `p` by sorting both and comparing.\n",
    "- **Steps:**\n",
    "  1.  Sort the pattern `p`.\n",
    "  2.  Iterate through all possible starting indices in `s` for a substring of length `len(p)`.\n",
    "  3.  For each substring, sort it and compare it with the sorted pattern.\n",
    "  4.  If they are equal, add the starting index of the substring to the result.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n \\* m log m), where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `p` (due to sorting each substring).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(m) for storing the sorted pattern and temporary sorted substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Character Count Comparison (Without Sliding Window Optimization):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea:** Similar to the optimized sliding window, but instead of efficiently updating the character counts, it recalculates the character count for each substring of `s` with the same length as `p`.\n",
    "- **Steps:**\n",
    "  1.  Count the frequency of each character in `p`.\n",
    "  2.  Iterate through all possible starting indices in `s` for a substring of length `len(p)`.\n",
    "  3.  For each substring, count the frequency of its characters.\n",
    "  4.  Compare the character counts of the substring with the character counts of `p`. If they match, add the starting index to the result.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n \\* m), where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `p` (due to counting characters for each substring).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(m) for storing character counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Using Character Frequency Arrays (Optimization of Sliding Window):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea:** This is a variation of the optimized sliding window that uses fixed-size arrays (of size 26 for lowercase English letters) to store character frequencies instead of hash maps (`Counter`). This can offer a slight performance improvement due to direct indexing.\n",
    "- **Steps:**\n",
    "  1.  Create a frequency array for `p`.\n",
    "  2.  Initialize a frequency array for the first window of `s`.\n",
    "  3.  Compare the frequency arrays. If they are equal, add the starting index 0 to the result.\n",
    "  4.  Slide the window through `s` (from index 1 to `n - m`):\n",
    "      - Decrement the frequency of the character leaving the window.\n",
    "      - Increment the frequency of the character entering the window.\n",
    "      - Compare the current window's frequency array with the pattern's frequency array. If they are equal, add the starting index of the current window to the result.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of `s`.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (for the frequency arrays of size 26).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `findAnagrams` method in the `Solution` class is set to use the `findAnagrams_sliding_window_array` (the most efficient) by default, but you can easily switch to any of the other approaches by uncommenting the corresponding `return` statement.\n"

    "**Explanation of the Sliding Window Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `n`: Length of the string `s`.\n",
    "    - `m`: Length of the pattern `p`.\n",
    "    - If `m` is greater than `n`, no anagrams can exist, so an empty list is returned.\n",
    "    - `p_count`: A `Counter` to store the frequency of each character in the pattern `p`. This serves as our target frequency map.\n",
    "    - `s_count`: A `Counter` to store the frequency of characters in the current sliding window of `s`.\n",
    "    - `result`: An empty list to store the starting indices of the anagrams found.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Sliding the Window:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The code iterates through the string `s` using a single loop with index `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This index represents the right end of the sliding window.\n",
    "    - **Expanding the Window:** In each iteration, the character `s[i]` is added to the `s_count`, updating its frequency in the current window.\n",
    "    - **Maintaining Window Size:** If the current window size (`i + 1`) becomes greater than the length of the pattern `m`, we need to shrink the window from the left. This is done by:\n",
    "      - Identifying the leftmost character of the window (`s[i - m]`).\n",
    "      - Decrementing its count in `s_count`.\n",
    "      - If the count of this leftmost character becomes 0 after decrementing, it's removed from `s_count` to keep the counter clean and efficient.\n",
    "    - **Anagram Check:** After adjusting the window (either expanding or shrinking), we check if the character counts in the current window (`s_count`) are exactly the same as the character counts in the pattern (`p_count`). If they are equal, it means the current window is an anagram of `p`, and we append the starting index of this window (`i - m + 1`) to the `result` list. The starting index is calculated as the current right index `i` minus the window size `m` plus 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Return Result:**\n",
    "    - Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing all the starting indices of the anagrams found.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Empty Pattern:** If `p` is empty, an empty substring in `s` (which exists at every position) would be considered an anagram. The current implementation returns `[]` as an empty pattern typically doesn't have non-empty anagrams. You might adjust this behavior based on specific requirements.\n",
    "- **Empty Text:** If `s` is empty, no anagrams of `p` (unless `p` is also empty) can be found.\n",
    "- **Pattern Longer Than Text:** If the length of `p` is greater than the length of `s`, no substring of `s` can be an anagram of `p`.\n",
    "- **No Anagrams:** If `s` contains no anagrams of `p`, the `result` list will be empty.\n",
    "- **Pattern of Length 1:** The sliding window correctly handles patterns of length 1.\n",
    "- **Pattern Equals Text:** If `p` is equal to `s`, and their lengths are the same, the starting index 0 will be in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided test cases cover the examples from the problem description and several additional scenarios to ensure the code handles various inputs correctly, including cases with no anagrams, multiple anagrams, overlapping anagrams, and different lengths of `s` and `p`.\n"

    "**Explanation of the Python Code (Direct Translation of C++):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `n`: Length of the string `s`.\n",
    "    - `m`: Length of the pattern `p`.\n",
    "    - If `m > n`, return an empty list as no anagrams can exist.\n",
    "    - `p_freq`: A list of size 26 initialized to zeros. This will store the frequency of each lowercase English letter in the pattern `p`.\n",
    "    - The code iterates through the pattern `p` and increments the count of each character in `p_freq` using its ASCII value.\n",
    "    - `s_freq`: A list of size 26 initialized to zeros. This will store the frequency of characters in the current sliding window of `s`.\n",
    "    - `result`: An empty list to store the starting indices of the anagrams found.\n",
    "    - `left`: The left pointer of the sliding window, initialized to 0.\n",
    "    - `right`: The right pointer of the sliding window, initialized to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Sliding Window:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The `while right < n:` loop iterates through the string `s` using the `right` pointer.\n",
    "    - `s_freq[ord(s[right]) - ord('a')] += 1`: The character at the `right` pointer is added to the current window's frequency count in `s_freq`.\n",
    "    - **Window Size Check:** `if right - left + 1 == m:`: This condition checks if the current window size is equal to the length of the pattern `m`.\n",
    "      - **Anagram Check:** `if s_freq == p_freq:`: If the frequency array of the current window `s_freq` is identical to the frequency array of the pattern `p_freq`, it means an anagram has been found, and the starting index `left` is appended to the `result` list.\n",
    "      - **Slide the Window:**\n",
    "        - `s_freq[ord(s[left]) - ord('a')] -= 1`: The character at the `left` pointer is removed from the window's frequency count as the window slides to the right.\n",
    "        - `left += 1`: The `left` pointer is moved one step to the right, effectively sliding the window.\n",
    "    - `right += 1`: The `right` pointer is always moved forward to expand the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Return Result:**\n",
    "    - Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing the starting indices of all anagrams of `p` found in `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points (Direct Translation):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This Python code directly mirrors the logic of the provided C++ code.\n",
    "- It uses frequency arrays (lists of size 26) to keep track of character counts, which is a common optimization for anagram problems with lowercase English letters.\n",
    "- The sliding window technique is employed to efficiently check for anagrams by updating character counts incrementally as the window moves.\n",
    "- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of `s`, as we iterate through `s` at most twice (once with the `right` pointer and effectively once with the `left` pointer).\n",
    "- The space complexity is O(1) because the frequency arrays (`p_freq` and `s_freq`) have a fixed size of 26, regardless of the input string lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The edge and test cases provided are the same as in the previous response, ensuring thorough testing of the translated code.\n"
