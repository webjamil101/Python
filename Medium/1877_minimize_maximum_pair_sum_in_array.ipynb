    "### Approach 1: Sorting and Two Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is the most efficient and intuitive way to solve the problem. The core idea is that to minimize the maximum pair sum, you should pair the smallest numbers with the largest numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sort the array `nums`** in non-decreasing order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements. The time complexity for this step is $O(n \\\\log n)$.\n",
    "2.  **Initialize two pointers**, `left` at the beginning of the array (index 0) and `right` at the end of the array (index $n-1$).\n",
    "3.  **Iterate with a `while` loop** as long as `left` is less than `right`. In each iteration:\n",
    "    - Calculate the **current pair sum** by adding the elements at the `left` and `right` pointers: `current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]`.\n",
    "    - **Update the maximum pair sum found so far**. Keep track of the largest `current_sum` encountered.\n",
    "    - **Move the pointers**: Increment `left` and decrement `right` to move toward the center of the array, effectively considering the next smallest and largest elements.\n",
    "4.  **Return the maximum pair sum** found during the iteration. This will be the minimized maximum pair sum for the entire array.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy works because by pairing the smallest with the largest, the sums tend to be as balanced as possible, preventing any single sum from becoming excessively large. The time complexity of the two-pointer loop is $O(n)$, making the total time complexity dominated by the sort, which is $O(n \\\\log n)$. The space complexity is $O(1)$ (or $O(\\\\log n)$ to $O(n)$ depending on the sort implementation).\n",

    "### Approach 2: Frequency Count (Counting Sort)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method can be faster than sorting if the range of numbers is small. However, if the range is large, this approach becomes less efficient due to the space required for the frequency array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Find the maximum value** in the `nums` array to determine the size of the frequency array.\n",
    "2.  **Create a frequency array** (or hash map) to count the occurrences of each number. This can be done in one pass through `nums`.\n",
    "3.  **Initialize two pointers**, `left` at the start of the frequency array (index 1) and `right` at the end.\n",
    "4.  **Iterate with a `while` loop** as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. In each iteration:\n",
    "    - If `left` has a count of 0, increment it.\n",
    "    - If `right` has a count of 0, decrement it.\n",
    "    - If both `left` and `right` have counts, we can form a pair. Calculate the sum `left + right` and update the `max_pair_sum`. Then, decrement the counts for both `left` and `right`.\n",
    "5.  **Return the `max_pair_sum`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach avoids a full sort, but its time and space complexity depend heavily on the range of the numbers. If the range is small, it can be $O(n + \\\\text{max\\_value})$, which is faster than $O(n \\\\log n)$. However, if the range is large, the space complexity can be a major drawback.\n",
