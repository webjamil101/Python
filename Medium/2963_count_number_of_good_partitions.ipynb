    "**Two-Pointer Sliding Window Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common and efficient way to solve this problem. The core idea is to find the maximum possible contiguous subarrays that form a valid partition. A partition is \"good\" if all its subarrays are mutually exclusive in terms of elements. This means if a number `x` appears in a subarray, it cannot appear in any other subarray of the partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be reframed as finding the number of valid cut points for partitioning the array. If we have `k` possible cut points, the number of ways to partition the array is `2^(k-1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Find Last Occurrences:** First, iterate through the array and store the last index of each unique number in a hash map. This step takes $O(n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Iterate and Expand Partitions:** Use a sliding window or two pointers to identify the valid partition blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Initialize a counter for partitions to 1.\n",
    "    - Initialize a pointer `j` that keeps track of the maximum last index of any number seen so far in the current partition.\n",
    "    - Iterate through the array with a pointer `i`.\n",
    "    - At each step `i`, update `j` to be the maximum of its current value and the last index of `nums[i]`. This ensures the current partition segment includes all occurrences of the numbers it contains.\n",
    "    - If at any point `i` becomes greater than `j`, it means the current partition segment has ended. All numbers within `[start_of_partition, i-1]` have their last occurrences within this range. We can make a cut here. Each time we find such a valid cut point, we double the number of possible partitions. The first partition is already accounted for, and each subsequent valid cut point doubles the possibilities, so we multiply the result by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calculate the Result:** The final result is the number of times we doubled the partitions, modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n"
