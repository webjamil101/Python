    "In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word\n",
    "\n",
    "- let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root \"help\" is followed by the word \"ful\", we can form a derivative \"helpful\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the sentence after the replacement.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "Output: \"the cat was rat by the bat\"\n",

    "- 1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000\n",
    "- 1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100\n",
    "- dictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters.\n",
    "- 1 <= sentence.length <= 106\n",
    "- sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.\n",
    "- The number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]\n",
    "- The length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]\n",
    "- Every two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one space.\n",
    "- sentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.\n"
