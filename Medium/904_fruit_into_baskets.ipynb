    "You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.\n",

    "Input: fruits = [1,2,1]\n",

    "**Approach 1: Sliding Window with a Hash Map**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialize Pointers and Map:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Initialize two pointers, `left = 0` and `right = 0`, to represent the start and end of the sliding window.\n",
    "    - Initialize a hash map (e.g., a Python `dict` or `collections.defaultdict`) to store the count of each fruit type within the current window.\n",
    "    - Initialize `max_fruits = 0` to store the maximum length found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Expand the Window:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Iterate with the `right` pointer from `0` to the end of the `fruits` array.\n",
    "    - For each fruit at `fruits[right]`, add it to our hash map and increment its count.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Shrink the Window (Condition Check):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - After expanding the window, check if the number of unique fruit types in our hash map is greater than 2.\n",
    "    - If it is, we need to shrink the window from the `left`. We do this by decrementing the count of the fruit at `fruits[left]`.\n",
    "    - If the count of `fruits[left]` drops to 0, it means that fruit type is no longer in our window, so we remove it from the map.\n",
    "    - We then move the `left` pointer one step to the right.\n",
    "    - This shrinking process continues until the number of unique fruit types in the hash map is back to 2 or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Update Maximum Length:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - After each expansion (and subsequent shrinking, if necessary), the current window `(fruits[left:right+1])` is a valid window containing at most two fruit types.\n",
    "    - We update `max_fruits = max(max_fruits, right - left + 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Return Result:** After the `right` pointer has traversed the entire array, `max_fruits` will hold the maximum number of fruits we can pick.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of trees. The `left` and `right` pointers each traverse the array at most once. Each element is processed a constant number of times.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the hash map will store at most two distinct fruit types at any given time. The number of unique fruit types is constant (2), so the space used by the map does not grow with the input size.\n"
