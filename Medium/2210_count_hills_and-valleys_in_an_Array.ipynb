    "# 2210. Count Hills and Valleys in an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. An index i is part of a hill in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are smaller than nums[i]. Similarly, an index i is part of a valley in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are larger than nums[i]. Adjacent indices i and j are part of the same hill or valley if nums[i] == nums[j].\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on both the left and right of the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number of hills and valleys in nums.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: nums = [2,4,1,1,6,5]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At index 0: There is no non-equal neighbor of 2 on the left, so index 0 is neither a hill nor a valley.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At index 1: The closest non-equal neighbors of 4 are 2 and 1. Since 4 > 2 and 4 > 1, index 1 is a hill.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At index 2: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 2 is a valley.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At index 3: The closest non-equal neighbors of 1 are 4 and 6. Since 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, index 3 is a valley, but note that it is part of the same valley as index 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At index 4: The closest non-equal neighbors of 6 are 1 and 5. Since 6 > 1 and 6 > 5, index 4 is a hill.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At index 5: There is no non-equal neighbor of 5 on the right, so index 5 is neither a hill nor a valley.\n",
    "  There are 3 hills and valleys so we return 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Input: nums = [6,6,5,5,4,1]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
