    "# Explanation of Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach 1: Brute Force\n",
    "#   - Iterates through all possible starting values for the hidden sequence within the given [lower, upper] range.\n",
    "#   - For each starting value, it generates the entire hidden sequence based on the differences.\n",
    "#   - It checks if all elements of the generated sequence fall within the [lower, upper] range.\n",
    "#   - If a valid sequence is found, it increments the count of possible sequences.\n",
    "#   - Time Complexity: O((upper - lower) * n), where n is the length of differences. This can be very high if the range [lower, upper] is large.\n",
    "#   - Space Complexity: O(n) to store the hidden sequence.\n",
    "#   - This approach is generally too slow for the given constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach 2: Tracking Minimum and Maximum Possible Values (Optimized)\n",
    "#   - Instead of generating all possible sequences, this approach focuses on determining the valid range of starting values for the hidden sequence.\n",
    "#   - It calculates the minimum and maximum possible values that the hidden sequence can reach *relative* to its starting value (assuming the first element is 0 for relative calculation).\n",
    "#   - It iterates through the `differences` array, keeping track of the cumulative sum of differences. The minimum and maximum cumulative sums represent the minimum and maximum deviations from the initial value.\n",
    "#   - If the first element of the hidden sequence is `start`, then the entire sequence will fall within the range `[start + min_relative, start + max_relative]`.\n",
    "#   - For the hidden sequence to be valid, all its elements must be within `[lower, upper]`. This gives us two inequalities:\n",
    "#     - `lower <= start + min_relative`  => `start >= lower - min_relative`\n",
    "#     - `start + max_relative <= upper`  => `start <= upper - max_relative`\n",
    "#   - The number of valid starting values (`start`) is the number of integers in the range `[lower - min_relative, upper - max_relative]`.\n",
    "#   - The number of integers in an inclusive range [a, b] is `max(0, b - a + 1)`.\n",
    "#   - Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of differences, as we iterate through the `differences` array once.\n",
    "#   - Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a few variables to track the minimum and maximum relative values.\n",
    "#   - This approach is efficient and suitable for the given constraints.\n",

    "**Explanation of the Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `min_val`: Keeps track of the minimum cumulative sum of differences encountered so far (relative to the initial element being 0).\n",
    "    - `max_val`: Keeps track of the maximum cumulative sum of differences encountered so far (relative to the initial element being 0).\n",
    "    - `current_val`: Stores the current cumulative sum of differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Iterating through Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The code iterates through the `differences` array.\n",
    "    - In each iteration, `current_val` is updated by adding the current difference.\n",
    "    - `min_val` and `max_val` are updated to keep track of the overall minimum and maximum cumulative sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calculating Bounds for the Starting Value:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `lower_bound_start`: Represents the minimum possible value for the first element of the hidden sequence (`h[0]`) such that no element in the sequence goes below `lower`. If the minimum relative value is `min_val`, then `h[0] + min_val >= lower`, so `h[0] >= lower - min_val`.\n",
    "    - `upper_bound_start`: Represents the maximum possible value for the first element of the hidden sequence (`h[0]`) such that no element in the sequence goes above `upper`. If the maximum relative value is `max_val`, then `h[0] + max_val <= upper`, so `h[0] <= upper - max_val`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Counting Possible Sequences:**\n",
    "    - The number of possible integer starting values for `h[0]` is the number of integers in the range `[lower_bound_start, upper_bound_start]`.\n",
    "    - `max(0, upper_bound_start - lower_bound_start + 1)` calculates this count. The `max(0, ...)` ensures that if the lower bound is greater than the upper bound (meaning no valid starting values exist), the result is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `differences` array, as we iterate through it once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a few constant space variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient and correctly handles the constraints of the problem. The provided edge and test cases cover various scenarios, including empty differences, single differences, cases with no possible sequences, and the examples from the problem description.\n"
