    "There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for n minutes. You are given an integer array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of the customers that enter the store at the start of the ith minute and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.\n",

    "During certain minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy. You are given a binary array grumpy where grumpy[i] is 1 if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the ith minute, and is 0 otherwise.\n",

    "**Explanation using Sliding Window:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Calculate Initial Satisfied Customers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - First, we iterate through the `customers` and `grumpy` arrays and calculate the number of customers who would be satisfied if the owner never used the secret technique. This is simply the sum of `customers[i]` where `grumpy[i]` is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Sliding Window for Potential Increase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We use a sliding window of size `minutes` to find the consecutive subarray where the owner being not grumpy would yield the maximum increase in satisfied customers.\n",
    "    - `max_potential_increase`: This variable keeps track of the maximum number of additional customers we can satisfy by using the technique.\n",
    "    - `current_potential_increase`: This variable represents the number of currently unsatisfied customers within the current window of size `minutes`.\n",
    "    - We iterate through the `customers` array using the index `i`.\n",
    "    - **Expanding the Window:** If the owner is grumpy at the current minute (`grumpy[i] == 1`), we add the number of customers at that minute (`customers[i]`) to the `current_potential_increase`. This is because if we use the technique during this minute, these customers will become satisfied.\n",
    "    - **Sliding the Window:** If the current window size (`i + 1`) exceeds `minutes`, it means we need to slide the window one step to the right. If the owner was grumpy at the minute that is now leaving the window (`grumpy[i - minutes] == 1`), we subtract the number of customers at that minute (`customers[i - minutes]`) from `current_potential_increase`. This is because if the technique was applied to the current window, the effect on that leftmost minute is now gone.\n",
    "    - **Updating Maximum:** In each iteration, we update `max_potential_increase` with the maximum value seen so far in `current_potential_increase`. This ensures we find the window of `minutes` where the most currently unsatisfied customers exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calculate Maximum Satisfied Customers:**\n",
    "    - Finally, the maximum number of satisfied customers is the sum of the customers who were already satisfied without the technique (`satisfied_without_technique`) and the maximum potential increase in satisfied customers we can achieve by using the technique once (`max_potential_increase`).\n",

    "**Time and Space Complexity:**\n",

    "\n",
    "    - We first calculate the number of customers who are satisfied when the bookstore owner is always in their given grumpy state. We iterate through the `customers` and `grumpy` arrays, adding `customers[i]` to `satisfied_without_technique` only when `grumpy[i]` is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Create Prefix Sum Array of Unsatisfied Customers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We create a prefix sum array called `unsatisfied_prefix_sum`.\n",
    "    - `unsatisfied_prefix_sum[i]` stores the total number of unsatisfied customers from the beginning of the day up to (but not including) the `i`-th minute.\n",
    "    - We iterate through the `customers` and `grumpy` arrays. If the owner is grumpy at minute `i` (`grumpy[i] == 1`), we add `customers[i]` to the current prefix sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Iterate Through Windows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We iterate through all possible starting positions `i` of a window of size `minutes`. The loop runs from `0` to `n - minutes`.\n",
    "    - For each window starting at index `i` and ending at `i + minutes - 1`, we can efficiently calculate the number of unsatisfied customers within this window using the prefix sum array:\n",
    "      `current_potential_increase = unsatisfied_prefix_sum[i + minutes] - unsatisfied_prefix_sum[i]`\n",
    "      - `unsatisfied_prefix_sum[i + minutes]` gives the total unsatisfied customers up to the end of the current window.\n",
    "      - `unsatisfied_prefix_sum[i]` gives the total unsatisfied customers before the start of the current window.\n",
    "      - Subtracting the latter from the former gives us the number of unsatisfied customers within the current `minutes`-sized window.\n",
    "    - We keep track of the `max_potential_increase` encountered across all possible windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Handle Case Where `minutes >= n`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the `minutes` the owner can be not grumpy is greater than or equal to the total number of minutes the store is open, then the owner can be not grumpy for the entire duration. In this case, all customers will be satisfied, so we return the sum of all elements in the `customers` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Calculate Maximum Satisfied Customers:**\n",
    "    - Finally, the maximum number of satisfied customers is the sum of the customers who were already satisfied without using the technique (`satisfied_without_technique`) and the maximum potential increase in satisfied customers we can achieve by using the technique once (`max_potential_increase`).\n",

    "**Explanation using Brute Force:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Iterate Through All Possible Start Times:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The core idea of the brute-force approach is to try every possible starting minute (`start`) for the bookstore owner to use their \"not grumpy\" technique.\n",
    "    - The loop `for start in range(n + 1):` iterates from `0` to `n` (inclusive).\n",
    "    - `start = 0` means the technique is used starting from the first minute.\n",
    "    - `start = n - minutes` means the technique is used starting from the last possible minute to cover `minutes` consecutive minutes.\n",
    "    - `start = n` represents the case where the technique is never used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Simulate the \"Not Grumpy\" Period:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Inside the outer loop, for each `start` time:\n",
    "      - `temp_grumpy = list(grumpy)`: We create a temporary copy of the `grumpy` array so that we don't modify the original array for other iterations.\n",
    "      - `if start < n:`: We only apply the technique if `start` is a valid starting minute within the day.\n",
    "      - `for i in range(start, min(start + minutes, n)):`: We iterate for `minutes` duration (or until the end of the day if `start + minutes` exceeds `n`) and set the corresponding elements in `temp_grumpy` to `0`, indicating the owner is not grumpy during these minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calculate Satisfied Customers for Each Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `current_satisfied = 0`: We initialize a counter for the number of satisfied customers in the current scenario.\n",
    "    - `for i in range(n):`: We iterate through all the minutes of the day.\n",
    "    - `if temp_grumpy[i] == 0:`: If the owner is not grumpy during the `i`-th minute (either originally or due to the technique), we add the number of customers `customers[i]` to `current_satisfied`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Keep Track of the Maximum:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `max_satisfied = max(max_satisfied, current_satisfied)`: After calculating the `current_satisfied` customers for a particular `start` time, we update `max_satisfied` if the current value is greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Return the Maximum:**\n",
    "    - After trying all possible start times (including the case where the technique is not used), the function returns the `max_satisfied` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2). The outer loop runs `n + 1` times. The inner loop to simulate the \"not grumpy\" period can run up to `minutes` times, and the final loop to calculate satisfied customers runs `n` times. In the worst case (e.g., `minutes` is close to `n`), this becomes O(n \\* n) = O(n^2).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(n) because we create a temporary copy of the `grumpy` array (`temp_grumpy`) in each iteration of the outer loop.\n"

    "# LeetCode 1052: Grumpy Bookstore Owner\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem asks us to find the maximum number of satisfied customers in a bookstore over $n$ minutes. We are given the number of customers arriving each minute (`customers`), whether the bookstore owner is grumpy at each minute (`grumpy`), and the number of consecutive minutes (`minutes`) for which the owner can choose to be not grumpy (this can be used at most once). Customers are only satisfied if the owner is not grumpy during the minute they enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Approach (Sliding Window):\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is to calculate the base number of satisfied customers (when the owner's grumpiness is as given) and then find the maximum additional customers we can satisfy by using the `minutes`-long \"not grumpy\" period at the optimal time. A sliding window approach is suitable for finding this optimal period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Calculate Base Satisfied Customers:** Iterate through the `customers` and `grumpy` arrays. If `grumpy[i]` is 0, add `customers[i]` to a variable `base_satisfied`. This represents the customers satisfied without using the special ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Initialize Sliding Window:** Create a window of size `minutes`. Calculate the potential gain in satisfied customers by applying the \"not grumpy\" ability to the first `minutes` of the day. This gain is the sum of `customers[i]` for all `i` in the first `minutes` where `grumpy[i]` is 1. Initialize a variable `max_gain` to this value and a variable `current_gain` to the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Slide the Window:** Iterate from the `minutes`-th minute to the end of the day. In each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Remove the effect of the minute that is now leaving the window (at index `i - minutes`). If `grumpy[i - minutes]` was 1, subtract `customers[i - minutes]` from `current_gain`.\n",
    "    - Add the effect of the new minute entering the window (at index `i`). If `grumpy[i]` is 1, add `customers[i]` to `current_gain`.\n",
    "    - Update `max_gain` with the maximum value seen so far between `max_gain` and `current_gain`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Calculate Maximum Satisfied Customers:** The final answer is the sum of the `base_satisfied` customers and the `max_gain` we found from the optimal `minutes`-long window.\n",
    "\n",
