    "To solve the problem **2579. Count Total Number of Colored Cells**, we need to determine the number of colored cells after `n` minutes based on the given rules. Below are all possible approaches to solve this problem, ranging from brute-force simulation to optimized mathematical solutions.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulate the process step by step for `n` minutes. Use a grid (or a set) to keep track of colored cells and their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a single colored cell at the center of the grid.\n",
    "2. For each minute, iterate over all currently colored cells and color their uncolored neighbors.\n",
    "3. Repeat the process for `n` minutes.\n",
    "4. Count the total number of colored cells at the end.\n",

    "#### **Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** \\(O(n^2)\\)  \n",
    "  Each minute, the number of new cells added grows linearly, and we need to process all cells in the current boundary.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** \\(O(n^2)\\)  \n",
    "  We need to store all colored cells in a grid or set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is not efficient for large `n` (e.g., \\(n = 10^5\\)) due to its high time and space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Mathematical Pattern Recognition**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe the pattern of colored cells after each minute and derive a mathematical formula to compute the result directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Observations:**\n",
    "\n",

    "#### **Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a recursive function to compute the result.\n",
