    "To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of boats required to carry a group of people, where each boat can carry at most two people with a combined weight up to a given limit, you can use a few different approaches. Let's analyze the problem with the given constraints and then explore the best solutions.\n",

However, given the constraint of `1 <= people.length <= 5 * 10^4`, this approach would be computationally infeasible due to its factorial or exponential time complexity. It would time out for even moderately sized inputs.\n",

    "This is the most efficient and recommended approach. The core idea is to be greedy by trying to pair the heaviest person with the lightest person to save as many boats as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the `people` array in ascending order.** This allows you to easily access the lightest and heaviest people.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For the given constraints, the **Greedy approach with sorting and two pointers is the most straightforward and effective solution**. Its $O(N \\log N)$ time complexity is well within the typical time limits for the given input size. The counting sort approach offers a slightly better theoretical time complexity but at the cost of more complex implementation and potentially higher space usage, depending on the constraints.\n"
