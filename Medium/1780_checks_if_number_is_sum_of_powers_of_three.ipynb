    "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a number `n` can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of three.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Distinct Powers of Three**: Powers of three are numbers like 3^0, 3^1, 3^2, 3^3, ..., etc. These are 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, etc.\n",
    "2. We need to check if `n` can be represented as a sum of these powers.\n",
    "3. A simple approach is to keep dividing the number by 3 (or reducing it) and track the remainders. If a number can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of three, its decomposition in base 3 should have no coefficient greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base 3 Representation**: If we convert `n` to its base 3 representation, we need to check if any digit in that representation is greater than 1. If it is, that means we can't represent `n` as a sum of distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "2. **Greedy Method**: Alternatively, we could repeatedly subtract the largest power of three smaller than or equal to `n` and check if we can reach zero.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "        if n % 3 == 2:  # If the remainder is 2, we cannot represent it as a sum of distinct powers of 3\n",

    "    return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **While Loop**: We keep reducing `n` by dividing it by 3.\n",
    "2. **Remainder Check**: If at any point, the remainder is 2, we know it's not possible to express `n` as a sum of distinct powers of 3 because we would have to use the same power twice.\n",
    "3. **Divide by 3**: This simulates the process of checking the base 3 digits of the number.\n",

    "- `91 % 3 = 1`, divide by 3 to get `30`.\n",
    "- `30 % 3 = 0`, divide by 3 to get `10`.\n",

    "- `3 % 3 = 0`, divide by 3 to get `1`.\n",
    "- `1 % 3 = 1`, divide by 3 to get `0`.\n",
    "- The base 3 representation of `91` is `10110`, which is valid because it only contains 0s and 1s.\n",

    "### Problem Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to determine if a given integer `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of 3 (such as 3^0, 3^1, 3^2, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Distinct Powers of Three**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Powers of 3 are numbers like 1 (3^0), 3 (3^1), 9 (3^2), 27 (3^3), 81 (3^4), etc.\n",
    "- The goal is to check if a number `n` can be written as a sum of distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the powers of 3 have a unique representation in base 3 (ternary system), where each \"digit\" in base 3 can only be `0`, `1`, or `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `0` means that particular power of 3 is not included in the sum.\n",
    "- A `1` means that particular power of 3 **is** included in the sum.\n",
    "- A `2` means that particular power of 3 would be used twice, which is not allowed because we are looking for distinct powers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the number `n` to base 3.\n",
    "2. Check if any of the digits in the base-3 representation is `2`. If there's a `2`, we cannot represent the number as a sum of **distinct** powers of 3 (because we'd have to repeat a power).\n",
    "3. If all digits are either `0` or `1`, then the number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def checkPowersOfThree(n: int) -> bool:\n",
    "    while n > 0:\n",
    "        if n % 3 == 2:  # If the remainder is 2, we cannot represent it as a sum of distinct powers of 3\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "        n //= 3  # Divide n by 3 to check the next \"digit\" in base 3\n",
    "    return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Line-by-Line Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`while n > 0:`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0. This is because we're breaking down `n` by dividing it by 3 in each iteration until we reach zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`if n % 3 == 2:`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `n % 3` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 3. In base 3, the remainders (or \"digits\") are `0`, `1`, or `2`.\n",
    "   - If `n % 3 == 2`, this means that in base-3 representation, there's a digit `2`, which indicates that some power of 3 would be repeated. This violates the requirement of using **distinct** powers of 3, so we immediately return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`n //= 3:`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This is an integer division, which effectively reduces `n` by dividing it by 3. This operation removes the least significant \"digit\" in the base-3 representation of `n`, and prepares `n` for the next iteration where we check the next digit in base 3.\n",
    "   - For example, if `n` is 13, we will divide it by 3, getting `4`. We repeat this process until `n` becomes 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`return True:`**\n",
    "   - If we complete the loop without encountering a `2` in the base-3 representation, it means that `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of 3. Therefore, we return `True`.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### **Example 1: n = 12**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to check if 12 can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 12 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 0 (`12 % 3 == 0`). No issues. We move on.\n",
    "2. `12 // 3 = 4`. Now check 4.\n",
    "3. 4 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1 (`4 % 3 == 1`). No issues. We move on.\n",

    "2. `21 // 3 = 7`. Now check 7.\n",
    "3. 7 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1 (`7 % 3 == 1`). No issues. We move on.\n",
    "4. `7 // 3 = 2`. Now check 2.\n",
    "5. 2 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2 (`2 % 3 == 2`), which means the base-3 representation of 21 contains a `2`. This indicates that some power of 3 is being repeated, so we immediately return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example 3: n = 91**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to check if 91 can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 91 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1 (`91 % 3 == 1`). No issues. We move on.\n",
    "2. `91 // 3 = 30`. Now check 30.\n",
    "3. 30 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 0 (`30 % 3 == 0`). No issues. We move on.\n",
    "4. `30 // 3 = 10`. Now check 10.\n",
    "5. 10 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1 (`10 % 3 == 1`). No issues. We move on.\n",
    "6. `10 // 3 = 3`. Now check 3.\n",
    "7. 3 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 0 (`3 % 3 == 0`). No issues. We move on.\n",
    "8. `3 // 3 = 1`. Now check 1.\n",
    "9. 1 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1 (`1 % 3 == 1`). No issues. We move on.\n",
    "10. `1 // 3 = 0`. We're done.\n",
    "11. The base-3 representation of 91 is `10110`, which is valid (it only contains `0` and `1`), so the function returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The time complexity is O(log₃(n)) because at each step, we divide `n` by 3, effectively reducing the size of `n` logarithmically. In base 3, this requires approximately `log₃(n)` divisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach effectively checks if a number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 3 by converting it into base 3 and ensuring that no digits are `2`. It operates with a time complexity proportional to the logarithm of the number, making it efficient for large values of `n`.\n"

    "- **Approach 1 (Mathematical Approach)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - We find the largest power of 3 that is smaller than or equal to `n` and subtract it from `n`.\n",
    "  - We continue this process for smaller powers of 3.\n",
    "  - If we can reduce `n` to zero, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Approach 2 (Base 3 Representation)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - We check the base-3 representation of the number.\n",
    "  - If any digit in the base-3 representation is `2`, we return `False` because it's impossible to use the same power of 3 more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Approach 3 (Recursive Approach)**:\n",
    "  - The recursive approach tries to subtract the current power of 3 from `n` and checks both including or excluding the current power.\n",

    "To solve the problem of checking if a number `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of three, there are several approaches we can consider, aside from the one we already discussed (base-3 method). Let's explore some alternative solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Greedy Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach involves greedily subtracting the largest possible powers of 3 from `n` until we either reduce `n` to zero or find that it is impossible to represent it using distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Start with the largest power of 3 that is smaller than or equal to `n`.\n",
    "2.  Subtract this power of 3 from `n`.\n",
    "3.  Repeat the process for the remaining value of `n` until `n` becomes zero.\n",
    "4.  If at any step, the same power of 3 would be used again, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code:**\n",
    "\n",

    "    i = 0\n",

    "\n",
    "    return n == 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We first generate a list of powers of 3 until it exceeds `n`.\n",
    "- Then we subtract the largest possible power of 3 from `n` iteratively.\n",
    "- If we can reduce `n` to zero, it means `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "- Otherwise, we return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Recursive Backtracking:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we recursively check if `n` can be represented as the sum of distinct powers of 3 by subtracting the powers of 3 from `n` and checking both inclusion and exclusion of each power.\n",

    "\n",
    "    return backtrack(n, 3 ** 15)  # 3^15 is the largest power of 3 <= 10^7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `backtrack` function tries to subtract the largest possible power of 3 from `n` or move to the next smaller power recursively.\n",
    "- We start from `3^15` (since 3^15 is the largest power of 3 less than 10^7) and check recursively if we can form `n` using distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "- We return `True` when we find a valid combination, and `False` if we reach the base cases where `n` becomes negative or we run out of powers of 3.\n",

    "### 3. **Dynamic Programming (Subset Sum Approach):**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach uses dynamic programming (DP) to track which numbers can be formed by a sum of distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Use dynamic programming to build a set of possible sums using distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "2.  Start with an empty set (containing zero) and iteratively add powers of 3 to this set.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We first generate the powers of 3 less than or equal to `n`.\n",
    "- We maintain a set `dp` that tracks the possible sums that can be formed using distinct powers of 3.\n",

    "- At the end, if `n` is in the set `dp`, it means `n` can be formed as the sum of distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Mathematical Insight (Using Base-3 Representation):**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the base-3 (ternary) representation of `n`, it can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 3 if and only if there are no coefficients of `2` in its base-3 representation. This method is similar to the approach we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Convert the number to base 3.\n",
    "2.  Check if any digit in the base-3 representation is 2.\n",
    "3.  If there is any digit `2`, return `False`. Otherwise, return `True`.\n",

    "    return '2' not in base3_representation\n",
    "```\n",

    "- Convert the number to its base-3 representation.\n",
    "- If the base-3 representation contains the digit `2`, then we return `False` because `2` would mean that a power of 3 is used more than once.\n",
    "- Otherwise, return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Iterative Subtraction with Power List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach generates all distinct powers of 3 and then iteratively subtracts the largest possible power from `n` until `n` becomes zero or we cannot subtract further.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Generate all powers of 3 less than or equal to `n`.\n",
    "2.  Iteratively subtract the largest power from `n`.\n",
    "3.  If `n` becomes zero, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.\n",

    "\n",
    "    for power in reversed(powers_of_three):\n",
    "        if n >= power:\n",
    "            n -= power\n",
    "\n",
    "    return n == 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We generate all powers of 3 up to `n` in the list `powers_of_three`.\n",
    "- We iterate through the list in reverse (starting from the largest power) and subtract the powers from `n` iteratively.\n",
    "- If at any point we manage to subtract down to zero, we return `True`, indicating that `n` is a sum of distinct powers of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Greedy Approach**: Efficient and easy to implement; works well for large numbers.\n",
    "2. **Recursive Backtracking**: Less efficient for large numbers, as it can have many redundant calls.\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Programming**: Can be useful for small-to-medium input sizes, but may use more space.\n",
    "4. **Mathematical Insight (Base-3 Representation)**: Very efficient and simple approach, leveraging the properties of base-3 directly.\n",
    "5. **Iterative Subtraction**: Efficient and straightforward but slightly less elegant than the base-3 method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Base-3 Representation Method** is the most efficient and elegant approach, as it directly uses the properties of ternary (base-3) number systems. However, depending on the specific constraints, any of the approaches can be adapted to suit the problem.\n"
