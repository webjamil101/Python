    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We ask `n` rabbits how many other rabbits have the same color as them. We are given an array `answers` where `answers[i]` is the answer of the $i^{th}$ rabbit. Our goal is to find the minimum possible total number of rabbits in the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brute-Force Approach (Conceptual - Not Easily Directly Implemented)**\n",
    "\n",
    "A true brute-force approach would involve trying all possible color assignments to the responding rabbits and then checking for consistency with the answers. For each possible assignment, we'd need to deduce the minimum number of uncounted rabbits. This approach is computationally infeasible due to the vast number of ways to assign colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the core idea we need to consider is consistency. If a rabbit answers \"x\", it implies there are $x$ other rabbits of the same color in the forest (including itself, making a group of $x+1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimized Approach: Grouping by Answers**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight here is to group the answers. Rabbits that give the same answer might belong to groups of the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an answer `k`. If a rabbit says there are `k` other rabbits of the same color, then there must be a total of `k + 1` rabbits of that color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we have multiple rabbits giving the same answer `k`, we can try to fit them into groups of size `k + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Count the occurrences of each answer in the `answers` array. We can use a hash map (or a dictionary in Python) to store the frequency of each answer.\n",
    "2.  Initialize a variable `min_rabbits` to 0.\n",
    "3.  Iterate through the unique answers and their counts from the frequency map. Let the current answer be `answer` and its count be `count`.\n",
    "4.  For each `answer`, we know that rabbits giving this answer belong to groups of size `answer + 1`.\n",
    "5.  To find the minimum number of rabbits for this `answer`, we need to determine how many full groups of size `answer + 1` can be formed from the `count` of rabbits that gave this answer.\n",
    "6.  The number of full groups is `ceil(count / (answer + 1))`. We can calculate this as `(count + answer) // (answer + 1)` using integer division.\n",
    "7.  For each full group, there are `answer + 1` rabbits. So, the contribution of this answer to the total minimum number of rabbits is `((count + answer) // (answer + 1)) * (answer + 1)`.\n",
    "8.  Add this contribution to `min_rabbits`.\n",
    "9.  After iterating through all the unique answers, `min_rabbits` will hold the minimum possible total number of rabbits in the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Approach (Same as Optimized)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimized approach described above is actually the best approach to solve this problem efficiently and correctly. It leverages the information provided by the answers to deduce the minimum number of color groups and their sizes.\n",

    "**Explanation of the Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `counts = Counter(answers)`: We use `Counter` from the `collections` module to efficiently count the occurrences of each answer in the `answers` list.\n",
    "2.  `min_rabbits = 0`: We initialize a variable to store the minimum total number of rabbits.\n",
    "3.  `for answer, count in counts.items():`: We iterate through each unique answer and its frequency.\n",
    "4.  `group_size = answer + 1`: The total number of rabbits in a color group where each responding rabbit says `answer` is `answer + 1`.\n",
    "5.  `num_groups = (count + answer) // group_size`: This calculates the minimum number of groups needed to accommodate `count` rabbits that gave the answer `answer`.\n",
    "    - If `count` is a multiple of `group_size`, then `num_groups = count // group_size`.\n",
    "    - If `count` is not a multiple of `group_size`, we need one more group to accommodate the remaining rabbits. `(count + answer) // (answer + 1)` effectively performs the ceiling division. For example, if `count = 5` and `group_size = 3`, `(5 + 2) // 3 = 7 // 3 = 2`, indicating we need 2 groups (3 + 2).\n",
    "6.  `min_rabbits += num_groups * group_size`: We add the total number of rabbits in these `num_groups` to our `min_rabbits` count.\n",
    "7.  `return min_rabbits`: Finally, we return the calculated minimum number of rabbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rabbits in the `answers` array. This is because we iterate through the array once to count the frequencies and then iterate through the unique answers (which is at most $n$).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, where $k$ is the number of unique answers in the `answers` array. In the worst case, all answers are unique, so $k$ can be up to $n$. However, the range of answers is limited (0 to 999), so the space complexity is practically bounded.\n"

    "**Explanation of the Brute-Force Approach (Conceptual):**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `numRabbitsBruteForce` function attempts to explore all possible color assignments to the `n` responding rabbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`is_consistent(assignment, current_answers)`:** This helper function checks if a given color assignment is consistent with the answers provided by the rabbits. It counts the number of rabbits of each color in the `assignment` and then verifies if each rabbit's answer matches the actual number of other rabbits of the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`find_min_rabbits(index, current_assignment, current_answers)`:** This is a recursive function that tries all possible color assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Base Case:** When `index` reaches `n` (all rabbits have been assigned a color), it checks if the assignment is consistent. If it is, it calculates the minimum total number of rabbits in the forest for this assignment. This involves finding the unique colors, the count of rabbits for each color, and then determining if any uncounted rabbits of those colors are needed to satisfy the answers. It updates `min_total_rabbits` if a smaller total is found.\n",
    "    - **Recursive Steps:** For the rabbit at the current `index`, it tries two possibilities:\n",
    "      - Assigning a new color (creating a new color group).\n",
    "      - Assigning an existing color (adding the current rabbit to an existing color group).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Main Logic:**\n",
    "    - It initializes `min_total_rabbits` to infinity.\n",
    "    - It calls the recursive `find_min_rabbits` function starting with an empty assignment.\n",
    "    - Finally, it returns the minimum total number of rabbits found.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This is a Brute-Force Approach (and Highly Inefficient):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exponential Complexity:** The number of possible color assignments grows exponentially with the number of rabbits. For each rabbit, we can potentially assign a new color or one of the existing colors. This leads to a very large search space.\n",
    "- **Impractical for Larger Inputs:** For even moderately sized input arrays, this approach will take an extremely long time to complete due to the vast number of possibilities it explores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time and Space Complexity of the Brute-Force Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** In the worst case, the number of possible color assignments can be very large (related to Bell numbers), making the time complexity exponential and completely impractical for the given constraints.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** The depth of the recursion can be up to `n`, and the `current_assignment` list can also grow to size `n`. The space complexity will be at least $O(n)$, but the overall space used during the exploration can also be significant due to the recursive calls and the storage of potential assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion on Brute Force:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While this code demonstrates a conceptual brute-force approach, it is highly inefficient and will not be feasible for the given constraints of the problem. The optimized approach (grouping by answers) is the correct and efficient way to solve this problem. This brute-force code is provided for illustrative purposes only to understand the nature of a less efficient solution.\n"

    "2.  **`min_rabbits = 0`:** We initialize a variable `min_rabbits` to store the minimum total number of rabbits.\n",

    "4.  **`group_size = answer + 1`:** For each `answer` given by a rabbit, it implies that there are `answer` other rabbits of the same color. Therefore, the total size of the color group is `answer + 1` (including the rabbit that answered).\n",

    "    - If `count` is perfectly divisible by `group_size`, then `num_groups` will be `count // group_size`.\n",
    "    - If `count` is not divisible by `group_size`, we need to form an additional group to accommodate the remaining rabbits. Integer division `//` combined with adding `answer` before division effectively performs a ceiling division. For example:\n",
    "      - If `answer = 1` (group size = 2) and `count = 3`, `(3 + 1) // 2 = 4 // 2 = 2` groups are needed (2 red + 1 red).\n",

    "\n",
    "6.  **`min_rabbits += num_groups * group_size`:** For each unique answer, we calculate the minimum number of rabbits belonging to those color groups (`num_groups * group_size`) and add it to the `min_rabbits` total.\n",

    "- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of rabbits in the `answers` array. We iterate through the array once to count frequencies and then iterate through the unique answers (which is at most $n$).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** $O(k)$, where $k$ is the number of unique answers in the `answers` array. In the worst case, all answers are unique, so $k$ can be up to $n$. However, the range of answers is limited (0 to 999), so the space used by the `Counter` is practically bounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient and correctly determines the minimum number of rabbits by optimally grouping the responses. The test cases cover various scenarios, including empty input, cases where all rabbits report 0, single rabbits, consistent answers, and mixed answer sets.\n"
