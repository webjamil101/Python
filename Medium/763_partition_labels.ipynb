    "You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string \"ababcc\" can be partitioned into [\"abab\", \"cc\"], but partitions such as [\"aba\", \"bcc\"] or [\"ab\", \"ab\", \"cc\"] are invalid.\n",

    "### 1\\. Greedy Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient way to solve this problem is with a **greedy algorithm**. The key insight is to determine the furthest a character's influence extends within the string. For each character, we must find its last occurrence. Once we have this information, we can iterate through the string and expand our current partition until it includes the last occurrence of every character within it. This guarantees we form the smallest possible partition that satisfies the condition, allowing us to maximize the number of partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Find Last Occurrences**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Iterate through the string `s` once.\n",
    "    - Create a hash map (or an array of size 26 for lowercase English letters) to store the **last index** of each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Iterate and Partition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Initialize `partition_end` to `0` and `start` to `0`. `partition_end` will track the furthest a character's last occurrence has extended, and `start` marks the beginning of the current partition.\n",
    "    - Iterate through the string with an index `i`.\n",
    "    - At each index `i`, update `partition_end` to be the maximum of its current value and the last index of `s[i]`. `partition_end = max(partition_end, last_index[s[i]])`.\n",
    "    - If `i` reaches `partition_end`, it means all characters from the current `start` to `i` have their last occurrences within this range. This is a valid partition.\n",
    "    - The size of this partition is `i - start + 1`. Add this size to your result list.\n",
    "    - Update `start` to `i + 1` to begin searching for the next partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This greedy strategy works because by always extending the current partition to include the last occurrence of every character within it, we are creating the smallest possible valid partition. This in turn maximizes the total number of partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\\. Two-Pointer Approach (Sliding Window)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is fundamentally the same greedy logic but can be visualized as a sliding window. We maintain a window that represents the current partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Find Last Occurrences**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Same as the greedy approach. Create a hash map to store the last index of each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Slide the Window**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Initialize a `left` pointer at `0` and a `right` pointer at `0`.\n",
    "    - Also initialize a `current_end` variable to `0`.\n",
    "    - Iterate with the `right` pointer from the beginning of the string.\n",
    "    - At each `right`, find the last occurrence of `s[right]` and update `current_end = max(current_end, last_index[s[right]])`.\n",
    "    - If `right` reaches `current_end`, it means the current window from `left` to `right` forms a valid partition.\n",
    "    - The size of this partition is `right - left + 1`. Add this to the result.\n",
    "    - Move `left` to `right + 1` to start the next partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method effectively slides a window, expanding its end (`right`) as necessary and only closing it (`left` moves) when it's guaranteed to be a valid partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches are effectively the same greedy strategy, but described with different terminology. Both have a time complexity of **O(n)** and a space complexity of **O(1)** (since the character set is fixed to 26 lowercase letters).\n",
