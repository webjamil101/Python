    "# 1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Medium**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have an empty stack with the two following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Push\": pushes an integer to the top of the stack.\n",
    "- \"Pop\": removes the integer on the top of the stack.\n",
    "  You also have a stream of the integers in the range [1, n].\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the bottom to the top) equal to target. You should follow the following rules:\n",

    "- If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it to the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to target, do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.\n",

    "**Problem Understanding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a `target` array and an integer `n`. You need to simulate building the `target` array using \"Push\" and \"Pop\" operations from a stream of numbers `1, 2, 3, ..., n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Solution's Logic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of your solution is to iterate through the `target` numbers and, for each `target` number, simulate pushing numbers from the stream (`current`) until you reach that `target` number.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `result = []`: This list will store the sequence of \"Push\" and \"Pop\" operations.\n",
    "    - `current = 1`: This variable represents the current number being read from the stream (1, 2, 3, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Iterating through `target`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `for number in target:`: You iterate through each number that you need to build in the `target` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Handling Numbers Not in `target`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `while current < number:`: This `while` loop is crucial. If the `current` number from the stream is less than the `number` you're trying to reach in the `target` array, it means `current` (and subsequent numbers up to `number - 1`) are not needed in the `target` array.\n",
    "      - `result.append(\"push\")`: You \"Push\" the `current` number onto the stack (conceptually).\n",
    "      - `result.append(\"pop\")`: Since `current` is not needed, you immediately \"Pop\" it off the stack.\n",
    "      - `current += 1`: You then increment `current` to move to the next number in the stream.\n",
    "    - This `while` loop effectively discards numbers from the stream that are smaller than the current `target` number by pushing and then popping them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Handling Numbers _in_ `target`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `result.append(\"push\")`: Once the `while` loop finishes (meaning `current` is now equal to the `number` you need from `target`), you \"Push\" this `number` onto the stack. This number will remain on the stack as it's part of your desired `target` array.\n",
    "    - `current += 1`: You increment `current` to prepare for the next number in the `target` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Return `result`:** After processing all numbers in `target`, `result` will contain the correct sequence of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Walkthrough (using `target = [1, 3], n = 3`):**\n",

    "_ `result.append(\"push\")` -> `result = [\"push\"]` \\* `current += 1` -> `current = 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iteration 2: `number = 3`**\n",
    "_ `while current < number` (i.e., `2 < 3`): This condition is `True`.\n",
    "_ `result.append(\"push\")` -> `result = [\"push\", \"push\"]`\n",
    "_ `result.append(\"pop\")` -> `result = [\"push\", \"push\", \"pop\"]`\n",

    "_ The `while` loop condition (`3 < 3`) is now `False`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Return `result = [\"push\", \"push\", \"pop\", \"push\"]`**\n",
    "This is the correct output for `target = [1, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correctness and Efficiency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correctness:** The logic correctly simulates the stack operations. It only keeps the necessary numbers and discards others.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** The code iterates through the `target` array once. Inside the loop, the `while` loop increments `current` from its previous value up to the current `target` number. In the worst case, `current` might go from 1 to `n` over the entire execution. So, the total number of \"push\" and \"pop\" operations added is proportional to `n` (or the last number in `target` if it's less than `n`). This makes the time complexity **O(n)**, where `n` is the maximum possible number in the stream.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** The `result` list can store up to `2 * n` operations in the worst case (e.g., if `target = [n]`, you might push/pop `n-1` pairs and then push `n`). So, the space complexity is **O(n)**.\n"

    "**Problem Statement Recap:**\n",
    "You are given a `target` array (strictly increasing) and an integer `n`. You need to simulate building the `target` array by reading numbers from a stream `1, 2, ..., n` and performing \"Push\" and \"Pop\" operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Solution's Logic (`buildArray` function):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `result = []`: An empty list to store the sequence of \"Push\" and \"Pop\" operations.\n",
    "    - `stream = 1`: This variable represents the current number being read from the conceptual stream of integers (starting from 1).\n",
    "    - `i = 0`: This is an index pointer for the `target` array, indicating which target number we are currently trying to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Main Loop (`while i < len(target) and stream <= n:`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This loop continues as long as two conditions are met:\n",
    "      - `i < len(target)`: We haven't processed all numbers in the `target` array yet.\n",
    "      - `stream <= n`: We haven't exhausted the available numbers in the stream (from 1 to `n`). This condition is important because the problem states the stream goes up to `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Inside the Loop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `result.append(\"Push\")`: In every iteration of the `while` loop, you conceptually \"Push\" the `current` number from the `stream` onto a stack. This is the first operation for any number coming from the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Conditional Check (`if stream == target[i]:`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **If `stream == target[i]`:** This means the number we just `Push`ed (`stream`) is exactly the number we need for our `target` array.\n",
    "        - `i += 1`: Since we've successfully matched a `target` number, we increment the `target` array index `i` to move to the next number we need to find.\n",
    "      - **Else (`stream != target[i]`):** This means the number we just `Push`ed (`stream`) is _not_ the number we need for our `target` array. It's an unwanted number that came before our desired `target[i]`.\n",
    "        - `result.append(\"Pop\")`: To remove this unwanted number from our conceptual stack, we immediately \"Pop\" it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `stream += 1`: After processing the `stream` number (either matching it with `target[i]` or popping it), we always increment `stream` to move to the next number in the conceptual stream (e.g., from 1 to 2, then 2 to 3, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Return `result`:** Once the `while` loop terminates (either all `target` numbers are found or the stream limit `n` is reached), the `result` list contains the complete sequence of \"Push\" and \"Pop\" operations.\n",

    "**Loop Termination:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `while 2 < 2` (False) and `4 <= 3` (False). Both conditions fail, so the loop stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return `result = [\"Push\", \"Push\", \"Pop\", \"Push\"]`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison to the Previous Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Previous Solution:** Focuses on iterating through the `target` numbers and then using a `while` loop to \"catch up\" the `stream` to the current `target_number`, performing \"Push/Pop\" for intermediate numbers.\n",
    "- **Current Solution:** Iterates `stream` by `stream` number. For each `stream` number, it \"Pushes\" it, then decides if it should be `Pop`ped based on whether it matches the current `target` number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches are correct and achieve the same time and space complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity: O(N)**, where N is the value of `n`. In the worst case (e.g., `target = [n]`), the `stream` variable will iterate up to `n`.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity: O(N)**, as the `result` list can contain up to `2 * n` operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is equally valid and can be slightly more intuitive for some people, as it directly mirrors the process of reading numbers from a stream and deciding whether to keep them or discard them.\n"
