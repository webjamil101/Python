    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Function to apply transformation:** Create a helper function `apply_transformation(num_str, x, y)` that takes the number as a string, digit `x` to replace, and digit `y` to replace with. It should handle leading zeros and the \"cannot be 0\" constraint.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The number of `x` and `y` choices is $10 \\times 10 = 100$.\n",
    "- We do this twice (once for `a`, once for `b`).\n",
    "- The string manipulation itself takes $O(L)$ time, where $L$ is the number of digits in `num` ($L \\le 9$ since $num \\le 10^8$).\n",
    "- Total time complexity: $O(100 \\times L)$ which is still small for these constraints, but the greedy approach is $O(L)$ and more elegant.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Greedy Approach (Optimal and Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most efficient and practical solution. It works by making the best possible local choice at each step to achieve the global optimum (maximum `a` and minimum `b`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **To maximize `a`:** We want to make the number as large as possible. This is achieved by changing the _leftmost_ digit that is not '9' to '9'. If all digits are '9', no change is needed.\n",
    "- **To minimize `b`:** We want to make the number as small as possible. This involves two sub-cases:\n",
    "  - If the first digit is '1': Change the _leftmost_ digit that is not '0' and not '1' to '0'. This preserves the leading '1' and makes subsequent digits as small as possible. If all subsequent digits are '0' or '1', no change is needed.\n",
    "  - If the first digit is not '1': Change the first digit (and all its occurrences) to '1'. This ensures the smallest possible leading digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps (as detailed in the previous response):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Convert `num` to a string.\n",
    "2.  **Calculate `a` (maximum):**\n",
    "    - Find the first digit `x` from left to right that is not '9'.\n",
    "    - If `x` is found, replace all occurrences of `x` with '9'.\n",
    "    - If no such `x` (all digits are '9'), then `a = num`.\n",
    "3.  **Calculate `b` (minimum):**\n",
    "    - Let the original string be `s`.\n",
    "    - If `s[0]` is '1':\n",
    "      - Find the first digit `x` from `s[1]` onwards that is neither '0' nor '1'.\n",
    "      - If `x` is found, replace all occurrences of `x` with '0'.\n",
    "      - If no such `x` (all subsequent digits are '0' or '1'), then `b = num`.\n",
    "    - If `s[0]` is not '1':\n",
    "      - Let `x = s[0]`. Replace all occurrences of `x` with '1'.\n",
    "4.  Return `a - b`.\n",

    "**Advantages:**\n",

    "### 2. Brute-Force Approach (Exhaustive Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach systematically tries every single possible combination of digit replacements to find the maximum `a` and minimum `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Idea:**\n",
    "For each of the two operations (getting `a` and getting `b`):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pick a digit `x` from `0` to `9` to be replaced.\n",
    "- Pick a digit `y` from `0` to `9` to replace `x` with.\n",
    "- Apply the replacement and validate the result (no leading zeros, not zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Initialize `max_val_a = 0` and `min_val_b = infinity`.\n",
    "2.  **Helper Function `transform(current_num_str, x_char, y_char)`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Convert `current_num_str` to a list of characters.\n",
    "    - Iterate through the list. If a character equals `x_char`, replace it with `y_char`.\n",
    "    - Join the list back into a string.\n",
    "    - **Validation:**\n",
    "      - If the resulting string has a leading '0' (and its length is greater than 1), it's invalid. Return -1 (or some indicator of invalidity).\n",
    "      - If the resulting string is \"0\", it's invalid. Return -1.\n",
    "      - Otherwise, convert the string to an integer and return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calculate `a`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Iterate `x` from `0` to `9` (as character `x_char`).\n",
    "    - Iterate `y` from `0` to `9` (as character `y_char`).\n",
    "    - `current_a = transform(str(num), x_char, y_char)`\n",
    "    - If `current_a` is valid (not -1), update `max_val_a = max(max_val_a, current_a)`.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - Iterate `x` from `0` to `9` (as character `x_char`).\n",

    "    - `current_b = transform(str(num), x_char, y_char)`\n",
    "    - If `current_b` is valid (not -1), update `min_val_b = min(min_val_b, current_b)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Return `max_val_a - min_val_b`.\n",

    "- Time complexity: $2 \\times (10 \\text{ for } x) \\times (10 \\text{ for } y) \\times O(\\text{number of digits})$ for string manipulation. For $num \\le 10^8$, this is about $2 \\times 100 \\times 9 \\approx 1800$ operations, which is still fast enough for given constraints but not optimal.\n",

    "### 3. Digit Manipulation without String Conversion (Mathematical Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach avoids converting the number to a string explicitly. Instead, it uses mathematical operations like modulo and division to extract and manipulate digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",

    "2.  **Helper Function `reconstruct_number(digits_list)`:** Takes a list of digits and reconstructs the integer. Includes validation for leading zeros.\n",
    "3.  **Calculate `a` (maximum):**\n",
