    "# 1233. Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Medium**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list of folders folder, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it. A sub-folder of folder[j] must start with folder[j], followed by a \"/\". For example, \"/a/b\" is a sub-folder of \"/a\", but \"/b\" is not a sub-folder of \"/a/b/c\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: '/' followed by one or more lowercase English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, \"/leetcode\" and \"/leetcode/problems\" are valid paths while an empty string and \"/\" are not.\n",

    "Output: [\"/a\",\"/c/d\",\"/c/f\"]\n",
    "Explanation: Folders \"/a/b\" is a subfolder of \"/a\" and \"/c/d/e\" is inside of folder \"/c/d\" in our filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: folder = [\"/a\",\"/a/b/c\",\"/a/b/d\"]\n",
    "Output: [\"/a\"]\n",
    "Explanation: Folders \"/a/b/c\" and \"/a/b/d\" will be removed because they are subfolders of \"/a\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: folder = [\"/a/b/c\",\"/a/b/ca\",\"/a/b/d\"]\n",
    "Output: [\"/a/b/c\",\"/a/b/ca\",\"/a/b/d\"]\n",

    "**Constraints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 <= folder.length <= 4 \\* 104\n",
    "- 2 <= folder[i].length <= 100\n",
    "- folder[i] contains only lowercase letters and '/'.\n",
    "- folder[i] always starts with the character '/'.\n",
    "- Each folder name is unique.\n"
