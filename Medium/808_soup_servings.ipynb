    "You have two soups, A and B, each starting with n mL. On every turn, one of the following four serving operations is chosen at random, each with probability 0.25 independent of all previous turns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pour 100 mL from type A and 0 mL from type B\n",
    "- pour 75 mL from type A and 25 mL from type B\n",
    "- pour 50 mL from type A and 50 mL from type B\n",
    "- pour 25 mL from type A and 75 mL from type B\n",
    "\n",
    "  > Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no operation that pours 0 mL from A and 100 mL from B.\n",
    "- The amounts from A and B are poured simultaneously during the turn.\n",
    "- If an operation asks you to pour more than you have left of a soup, pour all that remains of that soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process stops immediately after any turn in which one of the soups is used up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the probability that A is used up before B, plus half the probability that both soups are used up in the same turn. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.\n",

    "Input: n = 50\n",
    "Output: 0.62500\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we perform either of the first two serving operations, soup A will become empty first.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we perform the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we perform the fourth operation, B will become empty first.\n",
    "\n",
    "- So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 \\* (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: n = 100\n",
    "Output: 0.71875\n",

    "\n",
    "- If we perform the first serving operation, soup A will become empty first.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we perform the second serving operations, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2, 3], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we perform the third operation, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we perform the fourth operation, A will become empty on performing operation 1, and both A and B become empty on performing operation 2.\n",
