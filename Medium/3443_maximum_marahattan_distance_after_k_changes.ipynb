    "\n",
    "The key observation is that to maximize $|x| + |y|$, we want to move as far as possible in one of the four cardinal directions. For example, to maximize $x$, we'd prefer 'E' movements. To maximize $-x$, we'd prefer 'W' movements. Similarly for 'N' and 'S' for $y$ and $-y$.\n",

    "### Approach 1: Brute Force (Conceptual - Not Practical)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea:**\n",
    "Try all possible combinations of changing `k` characters. For each combination, simulate the movements and find the maximum Manhattan distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity:**\n",
    "There are $\\binom{N}{k}$ ways to choose `k` characters to change. For each chosen character, there are 3 other directions it can be changed to. So, roughly $\\binom{N}{k} \\cdot 3^k$ combinations. For each combination, we simulate $N$ steps. This is astronomically large and clearly not feasible for $N=10^5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2: Dynamic Programming (Still too Complex for large K)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea:**\n",
    "Let `dp[i][j][x_offset][y_offset]` be the maximum Manhattan distance after considering the first `i` movements, having used `j` changes, and the current relative position is `(x_offset, y_offset)`. The state space for `x_offset` and `y_offset` can be up to `i`, making this too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more refined DP approach might consider `dp[i][j]` as a set of reachable `(x, y)` coordinates using `j` changes up to index `i`. Still, the number of reachable coordinates can be very large.\n",

    "The coordinates can range from $-N$ to $N$. If we try `dp[i][j][x_coord][y_coord]`, the dimensions are $N \\times K \\times N \\times N$, which is $O(N^3 K)$, too slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 3: Focus on Maximizing a Specific Linear Combination (Greedy + Prefix Sums + Sliding Window)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Manhattan distance is $|x| + |y|$. This can be broken down into four components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Maximize $x+y$\n",
    "2. Maximize $x-y$\n",
    "3. Maximize $-x+y$\n",
    "4. Maximize $-x-y$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we maximize any of these, we are implicitly pushing the coordinates away from the origin in a diagonal direction. The maximum Manhattan distance will be the maximum of these four.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider maximizing $x+y$.\n",
    "A 'N' move changes $(x,y)$ to $(x, y+1)$, so $x+y$ becomes $x+y+1$. (Change in $x+y$ is +1)\n",
    "A 'S' move changes $(x,y)$ to $(x, y-1)$, so $x+y$ becomes $x+y-1$. (Change in $x+y$ is -1)\n",
    "A 'E' move changes $(x,y)$ to $(x+1, y)$, so $x+y$ becomes $x+y+1$. (Change in $x+y$ is +1)\n",
    "A 'W' move changes $(x,y)$ to $(x-1, y)$, so $x+y$ becomes $x+y-1$. (Change in $x+y$ is -1)\n",

    "To maximize $x+y$, we want to change 'S' or 'W' moves into 'N' or 'E' moves.\n",
    "A 'S' move contributes -1 to $x+y$. Changing it to 'N' contributes +1. Net change: +2.\n",
