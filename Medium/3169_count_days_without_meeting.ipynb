    "### Problem: 3169. Count Days Without Meetings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a positive integer `days` representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array `meetings` of size `n` where `meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents the starting and ending days of meeting `i` (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The meetings may overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "days = 10\n",
    "meetings = [[5,7],[1,3],[9,10]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meetings are scheduled on days [1, 3], [5, 7], and [9, 10].\n",
    "- The employee is free on day 4 and day 8, which gives a count of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "days = 5\n",
    "meetings = [[2,4],[1,3]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meetings are scheduled on days [1, 3] and [2, 4].\n",
    "- The employee is free on day 5, which gives a count of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "days = 6\n",
    "meetings = [[1,6]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meetings are scheduled for all working days, so the employee is not free on any day.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= days <= 10^9`\n",
    "- `1 <= meetings.length <= 10^5`\n",
    "- `meetings[i].length == 2`\n",
    "- `1 <= meetings[i][0] <= meetings[i][1] <= days`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem efficiently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the meetings**: First, we sort the meetings by their start day. This helps us process overlapping meetings easily.\n",
    "2. **Merge overlapping meetings**: We need to merge meetings that overlap. This way, we can avoid double-counting the days on which meetings occur.\n",
    "3. **Count available days**: Once we have merged the meetings, we can simply calculate the days when no meetings are scheduled. The total days minus the days covered by the merged meetings will give the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sort the meetings by their start day.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the meetings and merge overlapping ones.\n",
    "3. Count the number of days not covered by any meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures we handle the large input constraints efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def countDaysWithoutMeetings(days, meetings):\n",
    "    # Step 1: Sort meetings by start time\n",
    "    meetings.sort()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 2: Merge overlapping meetings\n",
    "    merged_meetings = []\n",
    "    for start, end in meetings:\n",
    "        # If there is no overlap, add the meeting as a new interval\n",
    "        if not merged_meetings or merged_meetings[-1][1] < start:\n",
    "            merged_meetings.append([start, end])\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            # If there is overlap, merge the current meeting\n",
    "            merged_meetings[-1][1] = max(merged_meetings[-1][1], end)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Step 3: Calculate the number of available days\n",
    "    unavailable_days = 0\n",
    "    for start, end in merged_meetings:\n",
    "        unavailable_days += (end - start + 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    available_days = days - unavailable_days\n",
    "    return available_days\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the Meetings**:\n",
    "   - We sort the meetings by their start day. This helps in easily merging overlapping meetings.\n",
    "2. **Merge Overlapping Meetings**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We initialize an empty list `merged_meetings` to keep track of merged meeting intervals.\n",
    "   - We iterate over the meetings, and if there is no overlap with the last added meeting, we add the new meeting to `merged_meetings`.\n",
    "   - If the meeting overlaps, we extend the end of the last merged meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Count Available Days**:\n",
    "   - We calculate the total number of days covered by meetings by summing the length of each merged meeting.\n",
    "   - Finally, the available days are obtained by subtracting the total number of unavailable days from the total `days`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sorting**: Sorting the meetings takes O(n log n), where n is the number of meetings.\n",
    "- **Merging**: Merging the meetings is O(n), as we process each meeting once.\n",
    "- **Counting Available Days**: This step is O(n), where we iterate through the merged meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**, which is efficient enough for the problem's constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We store the merged meetings, so the space complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the number of meetings.\n"
