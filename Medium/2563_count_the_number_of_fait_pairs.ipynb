    "### Problem Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given an array `nums` of integers and two integers `lower` and `upper`. We need to count the number of **fair pairs** `(i, j)` where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `0 <= i < j < n` (indices `i` and `j` are distinct and `i` comes before `j`).\n",
    "2. The sum of the elements at these indices satisfies `lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently finding pairs that meet the sum condition using a two-pointer technique.\n",
    "2. **Two-pointer Technique**: For each element `nums[i]`, we find the range of elements `nums[j]` (where `j > i`) such that `nums[i] + nums[j]` lies within `[lower, upper]`.\n",
    "3. **Binary Search for Valid Range**: For each `i`, use binary search to find the smallest `j` where `nums[i] + nums[j] >= lower` and the largest `j` where `nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`. The count of valid pairs for `i` is the difference between these two indices.\n",

    "    def countFairPairs(self, nums: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> int:\n",

    "        return count\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `nums` is sorted to facilitate the two-pointer approach. This allows us to efficiently find the valid range of `j` for each `i`.\n",
    "2. **Binary Search for Valid Pairs**:\n",
    "   - For each index `i`, we calculate the value `lower - nums[i]` to find the smallest `nums[j]` such that their sum is at least `lower`. The `bisect_left` function finds the first position where this value could be inserted to maintain order, effectively giving us the start of the valid range.\n",
    "   - Similarly, we calculate `upper - nums[i]` to find the largest `nums[j]` such that their sum is at most `upper`. The `bisect_right` function gives us the end of the valid range.\n",
    "3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The number of valid pairs for each `i` is the difference between the right and left indices found, which gives the count of `j` values that satisfy the condition for the current `i`. Summing these counts for all `i` gives the total number of fair pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach efficiently reduces the problem to a series of binary searches after sorting, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n"

    "**Understanding the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core task is to find the number of pairs of indices $(i, j)$ in a given array `nums` that satisfy two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Index Order:** $0 \\le i < j < n$, where $n$ is the length of the array. This means we are only considering pairs where the first index is strictly smaller than the second index. We avoid counting the same pair twice (e.g., (1, 2) and (2, 1) are considered the same pair).\n",
    "2.  **Sum Range:** `lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`. The sum of the elements at the chosen indices must fall within the specified inclusive range defined by `lower` and `upper`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**A Naive Approach**\n",

    "\n",
    "**An Optimized Approach Using Sorting and Binary Search**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's how the optimized approach works:\n",

    "5.  We can use binary search (specifically, `bisect_left` and `bisect_right` from the `bisect` module in Python) on the subarray `nums[i+1:]` to find the indices of the first element greater than or equal to `lower - nums[i]` and the first element strictly greater than `upper - nums[i]`.\n",
    "6.  Let `left_bound` be the index of the first element in `nums[i+1:]` that is $\\ge lower - nums[i]$.\n",
    "7.  Let `right_bound` be the index of the first element in `nums[i+1:]` that is $> upper - nums[i]$.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Sorting:** We sort the input array `nums`. This is crucial because binary search requires a sorted array.\n",
    "2.  **Iteration:** We iterate through the sorted array from the first element up to the second-to-last element (index `n-2`). For each element `nums[i]`, we aim to find how many elements `nums[j]` to its right (where $j > i$) satisfy the sum condition.\n",
    "3.  **Target Range:** For a fixed `nums[i]`, the other element `nums[j]` must lie within the range `[lower - nums[i], upper - nums[i]]` to make the pair fair.\n",
    "4.  **Binary Search:** We use `bisect_left` to find the index of the first element in the subarray `nums[i+1:]` that is greater than or equal to `lower - nums[i]`.\n",
    "5.  We use `bisect_right` to find the index of the first element in the subarray `nums[i+1:]` that is strictly greater than `upper - nums[i]`.\n",
    "6.  **Counting Fair Pairs:** The difference between the `right_index` and `left_index` gives us the number of elements in the subarray `nums[i+1:]` that fall within the desired range. We add this count to our total.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge and Test Cases to Consider:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of important edge and test cases, along with how the optimized approach handles them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Empty Array:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `nums = [], lower = 0, upper = 0`\n",
    "    - The loop in the optimized approach won't execute as `n` will be 0. The function will correctly return `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Array with One Element:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `nums = [5], lower = 0, upper = 10`\n",
    "    - The loop won't execute as `n` will be 1. The function will correctly return `0` because there are no pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **No Fair Pairs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `nums = [1, 2, 3], lower = 5, upper = 6`\n",
    "    - After sorting, the pairs and their sums are (1, 2) = 3, (1, 3) = 4, (2, 3) = 5. Only (2, 3) falls within [5, 6]. The algorithm should correctly count 1.\n",
    "    - `nums = [-5, -4], lower = 1, upper = 2`\n",
    "    - The sum is -9, which is outside the range. The count should be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **All Pairs are Fair:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `nums = [1, 2, 3], lower = 1, upper = 10`\n",
    "    - All pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3) have sums within the range. The algorithm should return 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Duplicate Numbers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `nums = [1, 4, 4, 5], lower = 5, upper = 9`\n",
    "    - Sorted `nums` is `[1, 4, 4, 5]`.\n",
    "      - For `nums[0] = 1`: we need sums in [4, 8]. `bisect_left` and `bisect_right` on `[4, 4, 5]` for this range will correctly identify the two 4s and the 5.\n",
    "      - For `nums[1] = 4`: we need sums in [1, 5]. `bisect_left` and `bisect_right` on `[4, 5]` will correctly identify the 4 and the 5.\n",
    "      - For `nums[2] = 4`: we need sums in [1, 5]. `bisect_left` and `bisect_right` on `[5]` will correctly identify the 5.\n",
    "    - The algorithm handles duplicates correctly because `bisect_left` and `bisect_right` find the boundaries of the range, including duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Negative Numbers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `nums = [-3, 0, 2], lower = -2, upper = 1`\n",
    "    - Sorted `nums` is `[-3, 0, 2]`.\n",
    "      - For `nums[0] = -3`: we need sums in [1, 4]. Only 2 satisfies this.\n",
    "      - For `nums[1] = 0`: we need sums in [-2, 1]. Only 0 satisfies this with itself (but $i < j$ so we consider 2).\n",
    "    - The algorithm works correctly with negative numbers as the sorting and binary search handle them naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Large Ranges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `nums = [1, 1000000000], lower = 1, upper = 2000000000`\n",
    "    - The algorithm should correctly count this as 1 fair pair. The magnitude of `lower` and `upper` shouldn't cause issues as long as they fit within standard integer types.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **`lower` equals `upper`:**\n",
    "    - `nums = [2, 3, 5], lower = 5, upper = 5`\n",
    "    - Only the pair (2, 3) sums to 5. The algorithm should return 1.\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of counting the number of fair pairs in an array where the sum of the pairs lies within a specified range `[lower, upper]`, we can use a two-pointer technique after sorting the array. Here’s the step-by-step approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently finding pairs that meet the sum condition using the two-pointer technique.\n",
    "2. **Count Pairs within Upper Bound**: Using the two-pointer technique, count all pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`.\n",
    "3. **Count Pairs below Lower Bound**: Similarly, count all pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `nums[i] + nums[j] < lower`.\n",
    "4. **Calculate Fair Pairs**: The number of fair pairs is the difference between the counts obtained from the upper bound and the lower bound counts, i.e., `count_within_upper - count_below_lower`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def countFairPairs(self, nums, lower, upper):\n",
    "        nums.sort()\n",
    "        n = len(nums)\n",

    "        def count_less_equal(target):\n",
    "            left, right = 0, n - 1\n",
    "            count = 0\n",
    "            while left < right:\n",
    "                if nums[left] + nums[right] <= target:\n",
    "                    count += right - left\n",
    "                    left += 1\n",
    "                else:\n",
    "                    right -= 1\n",

    "                if nums[left] + nums[right] < target:\n",
    "                    count += right - left\n",
    "                    left += 1\n",
    "                else:\n",
    "                    right -= 1\n",
    "            return count\n",
    "\n",
    "        return count_less_equal(upper) - count_less(lower)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `nums` is sorted to facilitate the two-pointer approach. This allows us to efficiently find the valid range of pairs.\n",
    "2. **Counting Pairs within Upper Bound (`count_less_equal`)**:\n",
    "   - Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start and `right` at the end of the array.\n",
    "   - If the sum of elements at `left` and `right` is less than or equal to `upper`, then all pairs from `left` to `right-1` are valid. Increment the count by `right - left` and move the `left` pointer right.\n",
    "   - If the sum exceeds `upper`, move the `right` pointer left to reduce the sum.\n",
    "3. **Counting Pairs below Lower Bound (`count_less`)**:\n",
    "   - Similarly, initialize two pointers.\n",
    "   - If the sum is less than `lower`, count all valid pairs and move the `left` pointer right.\n",
    "   - If the sum is not less than `lower`, move the `right` pointer left.\n",
    "4. **Calculating Fair Pairs**: The difference between the counts from `count_less_equal(upper)` and `count_less(lower)` gives the number of pairs where the sum lies within `[lower, upper]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge Cases and Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Small Array**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Input: `nums = [1, 2], lower = 3, upper = 4`\n",
    "   - Explanation: Only one pair `(1, 2)` with sum `3` which is within `[3, 4]`.\n",
    "   - Output: `1`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **All Elements Same**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Input: `nums = [5, 5, 5], lower = 10, upper = 10`\n",
    "   - Explanation: All pairs `(5, 5)` sum to `10`, which is within `[10, 10]`.\n",
    "   - Output: `3` (pairs are `(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)`)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Valid Pairs**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3], lower = 6, upper = 7`\n",
    "   - Explanation: No pair sums to a value within `[6, 7]`.\n",
    "   - Output: `0`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Large Range**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Input: `nums = [0, 1, 7, 4, 4, 5], lower = 3, upper = 6`\n",
    "   - Explanation: Valid pairs are `(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)`.\n",
    "   - Output: `6`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Negative Numbers**:\n",
    "   - Input: `nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4], lower = -6, upper = -5`\n",
    "   - Explanation: Valid pairs are `(-1, -4), (-2, -3)`.\n",
    "   - Output: `2`\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach efficiently counts the fair pairs with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting and O(n) for the two-pointer passes, making it optimal for large input sizes.\n"
