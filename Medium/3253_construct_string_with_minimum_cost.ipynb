    "\n",
    "You are given a string target, an array of strings words, and an integer array costs, both arrays of the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine an empty string s.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose an index i in the range [0, words.length - 1].\n",
    "Append words[i] to s.\n",
    "The cost of operation is costs[i].\n",
    "Return the minimum cost to make s equal to target. If it's not possible, return -1.\n",

    "The provided solution using a Trie and memoized search is a very efficient and standard approach to solve this problem. However, let's explore other possible approaches, although some might be less efficient or more complex to implement for this specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement (Implicit from the Solution):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a `target` string and a list of `words` with corresponding `costs`, find the minimum cost to construct the `target` string by concatenating words from the given list. You can reuse words. If it's impossible to construct the `target` string, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's analyze the Trie + Memoized Search approach first to understand its core idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Trie for Efficient Prefix/Suffix Matching:** The Trie data structure is used to efficiently check if a substring of the `target` starting at a particular index matches any of the given `words`. By traversing the Trie, we can quickly find all the words that are suffixes of the current portion of the `target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Storing Minimum Cost in Trie Nodes:** Each node in the Trie stores the minimum cost of a word ending at that node. This allows us to directly retrieve the cost of a matched word during the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Memoized Depth-First Search (DFS):** The `dfs(i)` function calculates the minimum cost to construct the remaining part of the `target` string starting from index `i`.\n",
    "    - **Base Case:** If `i` reaches the end of the `target`, the cost is 0 (we have successfully constructed the entire string).\n",
    "    - **Memoization:** The `f` array stores the minimum cost for each starting index `i`. If `f[i]` is already computed, we return the stored value to avoid redundant calculations.\n",
    "    - **Exploration:** For each starting index `i`, we traverse the Trie with the suffixes of the `target` starting from `i`. If we reach a Trie node that marks the end of a word (i.e., `node.cost < inf`), it means we have found a word that matches a suffix of the current part of the `target`. We then consider the cost of this word (`node.cost`) plus the minimum cost to construct the rest of the `target` string starting from the index after the matched word (`dfs(j + 1)`). We take the minimum of all such possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Possible Approaches (with Python code snippets and explanations):**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Dynamic Programming (without Trie):**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use dynamic programming where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to construct the prefix of the `target` of length `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def minimumCost_dp(target: str, words: list[str], costs: list[int]) -> int:\n",
    "    n = len(target)\n",
    "    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)\n",
    "    dp[0] = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    word_cost_map = {word: cost for word, cost in zip(words, costs)}\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n",
    "        for word, cost in word_cost_map.items():\n",
    "            if target.startswith(word, i - len(word)):\n",
    "                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - len(word)] + cost)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return dp[n] if dp[n] != float('inf') else -1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Usage:\n",
    "target = \"abcde\"\n",
    "words = [\"ab\", \"cde\", \"abc\", \"de\"]\n",
    "costs = [1, 2, 3, 1]\n",
    "result_dp = minimumCost_dp(target, words, costs)\n",
    "print(f\"Minimum cost (DP): {result_dp}\") # Output: 3 (abc -> cde)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:**\n",
    "  - `dp[i]` stores the minimum cost to form the first `i` characters of the `target`.\n",
    "  - The base case is `dp[0] = 0` (cost to form an empty string is 0).\n",
    "  - We iterate through each possible length `i` of the `target` prefix.\n",
    "  - For each `i`, we iterate through all the `words`. If a `word` is a suffix of the current `target` prefix ending at index `i-1`, we can potentially use this `word` to reach the current state.\n",
    "  - The cost to reach `dp[i]` would be the cost to reach `dp[i - len(word)]` plus the cost of the current `word`. We take the minimum of all such possibilities.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(`n` \\* `m`), where `n` is the length of the `target` and `m` is the total length of all words (in the worst case, we might check every word at every position).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(`n`) for the `dp` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Recursive Approach with Memoization (without Trie):**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the Trie + Memoized search but without the Trie for efficient matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def minimumCost_recursive_memo(target: str, words: list[str], costs: list[int]) -> int:\n",
    "    n = len(target)\n",
    "    memo = {}\n",

    "            if target.startswith(word, start_index):\n",
    "                remaining_cost = solve(start_index + len(word))\n",
    "                if remaining_cost != float('inf'):\n",
    "                    min_cost = min(min_cost, cost + remaining_cost)\n",
    "\n",
    "        memo[start_index] = min_cost\n",
    "        return min_cost\n",
    "\n",
    "    result = solve(0)\n",
    "    return result if result != float('inf') else -1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example Usage:\n",
    "target = \"abcde\"\n",
    "words = [\"ab\", \"cde\", \"abc\", \"de\"]\n",
    "costs = [1, 2, 3, 1]\n",
    "result_recursive = minimumCost_recursive_memo(target, words, costs)\n",
    "print(f\"Minimum cost (Recursive Memo): {result_recursive}\") # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation:**\n",
    "  - `solve(start_index)` calculates the minimum cost to construct the suffix of the `target` starting from `start_index`.\n",
    "  - Memoization is used to store the results of `solve` for different `start_index` values.\n",
    "  - For each `start_index`, we try to match all `words` at that position. If a match is found, we recursively call `solve` for the remaining part of the `target`.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** Similar to the DP approach without Trie, O(`n` \\* `m`).\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(`n`) for the memoization dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Trie is Preferred:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Trie-based approach is generally more efficient because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster Matching:** The Trie allows for efficient checking of multiple words simultaneously as prefixes/suffixes of the `target` at each position. Instead of iterating through all words, we traverse the Trie based on the characters of the `target`.\n",
    "- **Reduced Redundancy:** Once a path in the Trie doesn't match the `target`, we don't need to consider any words starting with that prefix further at the current position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Edge Cases and Test Cases (for all approaches):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Empty Target String:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    target = \"\"\n",
    "    words = [\"a\", \"b\"]\n",
    "    costs = [1, 2]\n",
    "    # Expected: 0\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Empty Word List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    target = \"abc\"\n",
    "    words = []\n",
    "    costs = []\n",
    "    # Expected: -1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Target Cannot Be Constructed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    target = \"abc\"\n",
    "    words = [\"de\", \"fg\"]\n",
    "    costs = [1, 2]\n",
    "    # Expected: -1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Single Word Matches the Target:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    target = \"apple\"\n",
    "    words = [\"apple\"]\n",
    "    costs = [5]\n",
    "    # Expected: 5\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Multiple Ways to Construct the Target:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    target = \"abab\"\n",
    "    words = [\"a\", \"b\", \"ab\"]\n",
    "    costs = [1, 1, 2]\n",
    "    # Expected: 2 (ab + ab)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Reusing Words:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    target = \"aaaa\"\n",
    "    words = [\"a\"]\n",
    "    costs = [1]\n",
    "    # Expected: 4\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Different Costs for the Same Word:** (The Trie approach in the provided solution handles this by storing the minimum cost)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    target = \"apple\"\n",
    "    words = [\"app\", \"apple\", \"app\"]\n",
    "    costs = [3, 5, 2]\n",
    "    # Expected: 5 (using \"apple\" with cost 5, or \"app\" with cost 2 + \"le\" - if \"le\" was present)\n",
    "    # Assuming \"le\" is not present, expected: 5\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Long Target String and Many Words:** (This is where the Trie's efficiency becomes significant)\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    target = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\" * 10\n",
    "    words = [chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(26)]\n",
    "    costs = [1] * 26\n",
    "    # Expected: 260\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While DP and recursion with memoization are possible approaches, the Trie-based solution provided is generally the most efficient and well-suited for this type of string matching and cost optimization problem. The Trie allows for quick identification of matching words, and memoization avoids redundant computations, leading to a better time complexity compared to the naive DP or recursive approaches.\n"
