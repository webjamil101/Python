    "# 2390. Removing Stars From a String\n",

    "\n",
    "- The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in \"leet\\**cod*e\". s becomes \"lee*cod*e\".\n",
    "- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in \"lee*cod*e\". s becomes \"lecod\\*e\".\n",
    "- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in \"lecod\\*e\". s becomes \"lecoe\".\n",
    "  There are no more stars, so we return \"lecoe\".\n",

    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"erase*****\"\n",
    "Output: \"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
