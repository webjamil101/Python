    "# 2616. Minimize the Maximum Difference of Pairs\n",

    "Note that for a pair of elements at the index i and j, the difference of this pair is |nums[i] - nums[j]|, where |x| represents the absolute value of x.\n",

    "The problem asks us to find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements in a **circular array**. This means that besides the usual adjacent pairs (`nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]`), the first and last elements (`nums[0]` and `nums[n-1]`) are also considered adjacent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the small constraints (`2 <= nums.length <= 100`), any linear time complexity algorithm will be extremely efficient. The core of solving this problem revolves around iterating through all possible adjacent pairs and tracking the largest absolute difference found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few possible algorithms, mostly variations of a single-pass approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm 1: Direct Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most straightforward and often the most explicit approach. We iterate through the array, calculate the difference for each standard adjacent pair, and then separately calculate the difference for the circular pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:**\n",
    "The array elements can be considered in two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Linear Adjacency:** Pairs `(nums[i], nums[i+1])` for `i` from `0` to `n-2`.\n",
    "2.  **Circular Adjacency:** The pair `(nums[n-1], nums[0])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We simply calculate the absolute difference for all these pairs and find the maximum among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Initialize a variable `max_diff` to `0` (since absolute differences are non-negative).\n",
    "2.  Get the length of the array, `n = len(nums)`.\n",
    "3.  Iterate from `i = 0` to `n - 2` (inclusive):\n",
    "    - Calculate the absolute difference `current_diff = abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1])`.\n",
    "    - Update `max_diff = max(max_diff, current_diff)`.\n",
    "4.  After the loop, calculate the absolute difference for the circular pair: `circular_diff = abs(nums[n-1] - nums[0])`.\n",
    "5.  Update `max_diff = max(max_diff, circular_diff)` one last time.\n",
    "6.  Return `max_diff`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of `nums`. We perform a single loop that runs `N-1` times, plus two constant-time operations outside the loop.\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a few auxiliary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def max_adjacent_difference_direct(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:\n",
    "        if len(nums) < 2:\n",
    "            return 0  # Or raise an error based on problem constraints (min length 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "        n = len(nums)\n",
    "        max_diff = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Iterate through standard adjacent pairs\n",
    "        for i in range(n - 1):\n",
    "            current_diff = abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1])\n",
    "            max_diff = max(max_diff, current_diff)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Calculate the difference for the circular pair (last and first element)\n",
    "        circular_diff = abs(nums[n-1] - nums[0])\n",
    "        max_diff = max(max_diff, circular_diff)\n",
    "\n",
    "        return max_diff\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test cases\n",
    "solution = Solution()\n",
    "print(f\"[1,2,4] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_direct([1,2,4])}\")       # Output: 3\n",
    "print(f\"[-5,-10,-5] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_direct([-5,-10,-5])}\") # Output: 5\n",
    "print(f\"[10,1,5,20] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_direct([10,1,5,20])}\") # Output: 15\n",
    "print(f\"[2, 5] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_direct([2, 5])}\")          # Output: 3\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm 2: Extended Array (Simulated Circularity)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach simplifies the loop by modifying the array slightly to treat the circularity as a linear adjacency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:**\n",
    "By appending the first element of the array to its end, we effectively create a temporary linear array where all adjacent pairs (including the original circular one) can be accessed using the same `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create a new list `extended_nums` by taking `nums` and appending `nums[0]` to it.\n",
    "    - Example: `[1, 2, 4]` becomes `[1, 2, 4, 1]`.\n",
    "2.  Initialize `max_diff = 0`.\n",
    "3.  Iterate from `i = 0` to `len(nums) - 1` (original length of `nums`):\n",
    "    - Calculate `current_diff = abs(extended_nums[i] - extended_nums[i+1])`.\n",
    "    - Update `max_diff = max(max_diff, current_diff)`.\n",
    "4.  Return `max_diff`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** O(N). Appending the element to create `extended_nums` takes O(N), and the subsequent loop runs `N` times.\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** O(N) for creating the `extended_nums` list. For the given constraint of N=100, this is negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def max_adjacent_difference_extended(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:\n",
    "        if len(nums) < 2:\n",
    "            return 0\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Create an extended list to simulate circularity\n",
    "        extended_nums = nums + [nums[0]]\n",
    "        max_diff = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Iterate through the extended list to cover all adjacent pairs\n",
    "        # The loop runs for the original length 'n', as extended_nums has n+1 elements\n",
    "        # so extended_nums[i+1] will cover the wrap-around for the last element.\n",
    "        for i in range(len(nums)): # Loop 'n' times for 'n' pairs\n",
    "            current_diff = abs(extended_nums[i] - extended_nums[i+1])\n",
    "            max_diff = max(max_diff, current_diff)\n",
    "\n",
    "        return max_diff\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test cases\n",
    "solution = Solution()\n",
    "print(f\"[1,2,4] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_extended([1,2,4])}\")       # Output: 3\n",
    "print(f\"[-5,-10,-5] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_extended([-5,-10,-5])}\") # Output: 5\n",
    "print(f\"[10,1,5,20] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_extended([10,1,5,20])}\") # Output: 15\n",
    "print(f\"[2, 5] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_extended([2, 5])}\")          # Output: 3\n",

    "### Algorithm 3: Pythonic One-Liner (Using Generator Expression with Modulo)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a concise and elegant way to implement the direct iteration logic, particularly favored in Python for its readability when dealing with iterables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:**\n",
    "We can use the modulo operator (`%`) to handle the circular indexing within a single loop. For any index `i`, the next adjacent element in a circular array is at `(i + 1) % n`, where `n` is the array's length. This correctly maps the index `n-1` to `0` (the first element) for the last pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Use a generator expression to compute `abs(nums[i] - nums[(i + 1) % n])` for each `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.\n",
    "2.  Pass this generator expression directly to Python's built-in `max()` function.\n",
    "3.  Return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:** O(N). The generator iterates through the array once, and `max()` processes these values efficiently.\n",
    "**Space Complexity:** O(1) because a generator expression does not create an intermediate list in memory; it yields values one by one, making it memory-efficient for very large arrays (though not strictly necessary given N=100).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def max_adjacent_difference_oneliner(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:\n",
    "        if len(nums) < 2:\n",
    "            return 0\n",
    "\n",
    "        n = len(nums)\n",
    "        # Use a generator expression with modulo for circular indexing\n",
    "        # and find the maximum absolute difference\n",
    "        return max(abs(nums[i] - nums[(i + 1) % n]) for i in range(n))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test cases\n",
    "solution = Solution()\n",
    "print(f\"[1,2,4] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_oneliner([1,2,4])}\")       # Output: 3\n",
    "print(f\"[-5,-10,-5] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_oneliner([-5,-10,-5])}\") # Output: 5\n",
    "print(f\"[10,1,5,20] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_oneliner([10,1,5,20])}\") # Output: 15\n",
    "print(f\"[2, 5] -> {solution.max_adjacent_difference_oneliner([2, 5])}\")          # Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
