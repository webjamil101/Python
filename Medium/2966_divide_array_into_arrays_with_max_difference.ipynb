    "The problem asks us to divide an array `nums` of size `n` (where `n` is a multiple of 3) into `n / 3` arrays of size 3. The crucial condition is that for each of these 3-element subarrays, the difference between _any_ two elements must be less than or equal to `k`. If a valid division is possible, return any valid 2D array; otherwise, return an empty array.\n",

    "\n",
    "The most important insight to solve this problem efficiently is to **sort the input array `nums` first.**\n",

    "Why sorting?\n",
    "If we want the difference between _any_ two elements in a group of three to be at most `k`, this implies that the difference between the smallest and largest element in that group must be at most `k`. If we sort the elements, we can easily pick three consecutive elements. If `num[i]`, `num[i+1]`, `num[i+2]` are sorted, then `num[i+2] - num[i]` is the maximum difference within that group. If this maximum difference is $\\le k$, then all other differences within the group (e.g., `num[i+1] - num[i]`, `num[i+2] - num[i+1]`) will also be $\\le k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This greedy approach works because sorting allows us to try and form groups with the smallest possible differences. If we _can't_ form a valid group with the smallest available elements, then including larger elements later would only make the differences even larger, making it impossible.\n",

    "   c. If `nums[i+2] - nums[i] > k`: It's impossible to satisfy the condition for this group. Since the array is sorted, any other permutation or combination involving these numbers would also lead to a difference greater than `k` (or equal, but not better). Therefore, return an empty array `[]` immediately.\n",

This approach essentially mimics the sorted pass, but the logic for checking `k` within a group that spans non-consecutive numbers in the frequency array becomes complex.\n",
    "    **Simpler Refinement:** Instead of forming groups during the counting sort pass, first use the frequency array to reconstruct a truly sorted `nums` array. Then, apply Algorithm 1. This would be `O(N + max_val)` for the \"sort\" and `O(N)` for grouping.\n",

Its $O(N \\log N)$ time complexity is dominated by the sort, and it correctly leverages the property that to minimize the difference between the smallest and largest in a group, you should pick the smallest available numbers.\n",

    "The Counting Sort approach offers an alternative if the range of values is very small, but it's generally more complex to implement correctly for this specific problem's grouping logic.\n",
