    "  2.  Initialize `repeated = -1`.\n",
    "  3.  Iterate through each element `num` in the `grid`.\n",
    "  4.  If `num` is already in `seen`, then `repeated = num`.\n",
    "  5.  Otherwise, add `num` to `seen`.\n",
    "  6.  Create a set of all numbers from 1 to `n*n`.\n",
    "  7.  Find the difference between this set and `seen`. The single element in the difference is the missing number (`missing`).\n",
    "  8.  Return `[repeated, missing]`.\n",

    "  2.  Initialize `repeated = -1`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Using Sum and Sum of Squares:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea:** Calculate the actual sum and sum of squares of all elements in the `grid`. Compare these with the expected sum and sum of squares of numbers from 1 to `n^2`. The differences can help identify the missing and repeating numbers.\n",

    "      - `SS_actual = SS_expected + a^2 - b^2` => `a^2 - b^2 = SS_actual - SS_expected` (Equation 2)\n",

    "- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant extra space is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Using Bit Manipulation (XOR):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea:** Use the XOR operation to identify the missing and repeating numbers. The XOR of a number with itself is 0.\n",

    "- **Algorithm:**\n",

    "  4.  Find the rightmost set bit in `xor_sum`. Let this bit position be `rightmost_bit = xor_sum & ~(xor_sum - 1)`. This bit is set in either `a` or `b` (but not both).\n",

    "  6.  Iterate through all elements in the `grid`. If the `rightmost_bit` is set in the current element, XOR it with `group_a`; otherwise, XOR it with `group_b`.\n",
    "  7.  Iterate through the numbers from 1 to `n*n`. If the `rightmost_bit` is set in the current number, XOR it with `group_a`; otherwise, XOR it with `group_b`.\n",
    "  8.  Now, either `group_a` will be the repeating number (`a`) and `group_b` will be the missing number (`b`), or vice versa.\n",
    "  9.  To determine which is which, iterate through the `grid` again and count the occurrences of `group_a`. If the count is 2, then `group_a` is the repeating number and `group_b` is the missing number. Otherwise, `group_b` is the repeating number and `group_a` is the missing number.\n",
    "  10. Return the result array `[repeating_number, missing_number]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) to iterate through the grid multiple times. The XOR operations are constant time. So, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2)**.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant extra space is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the Best Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Frequency Array/Hash Set/Hash Map** approach is straightforward to implement and understand.\n",
    "- The **Sum and Sum of Squares** approach is mathematically elegant and uses constant extra space. However, it might be susceptible to integer overflow issues if `n` is large, although the constraints suggest it should be fine.\n",
    "- The **Bit Manipulation (XOR)** approach is efficient in terms of space complexity and can be slightly faster in practice due to the nature of bitwise operations. It might be a bit trickier to understand initially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the constraints (`n <= 50`), all three main approaches should be efficient enough in terms of time complexity. The choice often comes down to ease of implementation and potential for edge cases (like overflow in the sum-based approach). The **Frequency Array or Hash Set** approach is generally considered the most intuitive and safe for these constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to handle the output format as a 0-indexed array `[a, b]` where `a` is the repeating number and `b` is the missing number.\n"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`MissingRepeatedFinder` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The class encapsulates the logic for finding the missing and repeated numbers.\n",
    "    - The `__init__` method initializes the `grid` and its size `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`find_missing_repeated_instance(self)` (Instance Method):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This method implements the most straightforward approach using a `Counter` to count the frequency of each number in the grid.\n",
    "    - It iterates through the grid to populate the counts.\n",
    "    - Then, it iterates from 1 to `n*n` to find the number with a count of 2 (repeated) and the number with a count of 0 (missing).\n",
    "    - This method is called on an instance of the `MissingRepeatedFinder` class (e.g., `finder.find_missing_repeated_instance()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **`is_good_number_set(numbers: set[int], n_squared: int)` (Static Method):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This method is decorated with `@staticmethod`. It belongs to the class but doesn't operate on any specific instance of the class.\n",
    "    - It takes a set of numbers (presumably from the grid) and `n_squared` as input.\n",
    "    - It checks if the set contains exactly `n_squared - 1` unique numbers and if all numbers from 1 to `n_squared` appear exactly once in the expected range (considering one is missing).\n",
    "    - You call this method directly on the class itself (e.g., `MissingRepeatedFinder.is_good_number_set(...)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **`find_by_elimination(cls, grid: list[list[int]])` (Class Method):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This method is decorated with `@classmethod`. It receives the class itself (`cls`) as the first argument instead of the instance (`self`).\n",
    "    - It provides an alternative (though potentially less efficient) way to find the missing and repeated numbers.\n",
    "    - It counts the occurrences of all elements in the grid.\n",
    "    - It identifies the repeated number based on the count being 2.\n",
    "    - It finds the missing number by checking which number in the range 1 to `n*n` is not present in the grid's elements.\n",
    "    - You call this method directly on the class itself (e.g., `MissingRepeatedFinder.find_by_elimination(grid)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **`run_tests_oop(finder_class)`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This function takes the `MissingRepeatedFinder` class as input.\n",
    "    - It creates instances of the class to test the `find_missing_repeated_instance` method.\n",
    "    - It calls the class method `find_by_elimination` directly on the class.\n",
    "    - It also tests the static method `is_good_number_set` with various valid and invalid sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Edge Cases in `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`:**\n",
    "    - The `run_edge_case` helper function simplifies testing edge cases.\n",
    "    - Several edge cases are included:\n",
    "      - Smallest possible grid (`n=2`).\n",
    "      - Repeated number appearing at the beginning or end.\n",
    "      - Missing number being the first or last in the expected sequence.\n",
    "      - Repeated and missing numbers being adjacent in the expected sequence.\n",
    "      - A larger grid with a simple repeat and missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive implementation demonstrates the use of instance methods, static methods, and class methods within an OOP structure to solve the problem and includes a test suite with various edge cases.\n"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`FindMissingRepeatedSumSquaresOOP` Class:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The class encapsulates the logic using the sum and sum of squares method.\n",
    "    - The `__init__` method initializes the `grid`, `n`, and `n_squared`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`find_missing_repeated_instance(self)` (Instance Method):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Calculates the actual sum (`s_actual`) and sum of squares (`ss_actual`) of the elements in the grid.\n",
    "    - Calculates the expected sum (`s_expected`) and sum of squares (`ss_expected`) for numbers from 1 to `n^2` using formulas.\n",
    "    - Uses the differences to set up equations:\n",
    "      - `a - b = s_actual - s_expected`\n",
    "      - `a^2 - b^2 = ss_actual - ss_expected`\n",
    "    - Solves these equations to find the repeated (`a`) and missing (`b`) numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **`calculate_expected_sum(n_squared: int)` (Static Method):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A static method that takes `n_squared` as input and returns the expected sum of numbers from 1 to `n_squared`. It doesn't depend on any instance state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **`find_missing_repeated_class(cls, grid: list[list[int]])` (Class Method):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A class method that performs the same logic as the instance method but receives the class itself (`cls`) as the first argument.\n",
    "    - It calls the static method `cls.calculate_expected_sum()` to get the expected sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **`find_missing_repeated_procedural_sum_squares(grid)` (Procedural Function):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A standalone function that implements the sum and sum of squares logic without using classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **`run_tests_sum_squares(finder_func, approach_name)`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A helper function to run tests for a given finder function (instance method wrapped in a lambda, class method, or procedural function).\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Edge Cases:**\n",
    "    - The `run_edge_case_sum_squares` function tests various edge scenarios:\n",
    "      - Smallest grid (`n=2`).\n",
    "      - Repeated number at the beginning or end.\n",
    "      - Missing number at the beginning or end of the expected range.\n",
    "      - Repeated and missing numbers being adjacent in the expected sequence.\n",
    "      - A larger grid with a simple repeat and missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, it will execute the test cases for the OOP (instance and class methods) and procedural approaches using the sum and sum of squares technique, along with specific edge case testing. The output will indicate whether each test passed or failed.\n"
