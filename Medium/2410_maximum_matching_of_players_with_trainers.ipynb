    "## 2410\\. Match Players and Trainers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Description:**\n",
    "You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, `players` and `trainers`, where `players[i]` is the ability of the $i$-th player and `trainers[j]` is the training capacity of the $j$-th trainer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A player `i` can be matched with a trainer `j` if `players[i] <= trainers[j]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum number of successful matches. Each player and each trainer can be used at most once.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach: Greedy with Two Pointers (Optimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:**\n",
    "The most intuitive and efficient approach is a greedy one. If we sort both the `players` and `trainers` arrays, we can iterate through them simultaneously using two pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy strategy is as follows:\n",
    "To maximize the number of matches, for the smallest available player, we should try to match them with the smallest available trainer who can train them. If the smallest player can be trained by the smallest available trainer, we make that match and move both to the next available person. If the smallest player cannot be trained by the smallest available trainer, then that trainer cannot train any larger player either (since the arrays are sorted). Thus, we discard that trainer and try the next smallest trainer with the current player.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy works because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sorting:** Ensures we always consider the smallest abilities/capacities first.\n",
    "2.  **Greedy Choice:** By matching the smallest possible player with the smallest possible trainer, we leave larger players and larger trainers available for future, potentially more difficult, matches. This preserves options for subsequent pairings, leading to the overall maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Sort the `players` array in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "2.  Sort the `trainers` array in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "3.  Initialize two pointers, `i` for `players` and `j` for `trainers`, both starting at `0`.\n",
    "4.  Initialize a `matches` counter to `0`.\n",
    "5.  While `i` is within the bounds of `players` and `j` is within the bounds of `trainers`:\n",
    "    a. **If `players[i] <= trainers[j]`:** \\* A match is possible. Increment `matches`. \\* Move to the next player (`i++`) and the next trainer (`j++`) as both are now used.\n",
    "    b. **Else (`players[i] > trainers[j]`):** \\* The current player (`players[i]`) is too skilled for the current trainer (`trainers[j]`). \\* Since `trainers` is sorted, this `trainers[j]` also cannot train any subsequent player (who would have equal or greater skill than `players[i]`). \\* Therefore, discard this trainer and move to the next trainer (`j++`). The current player `players[i]` remains available for a potentially stronger trainer.\n",
    "6.  Return `matches`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sorting `players`: $O(P \\\\log P)$, where $P$ is the number of players.\n",
    "- Sorting `trainers`: $O(T \\\\log T)$, where $T$ is the number of trainers.\n",
    "- Two-pointer traversal: $O(\\\\min(P, T))$ in the worst case.\n",
    "- Overall: $O(P \\\\log P + T \\\\log T)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $O(1)$ if sorting is in-place (e.g., Python's `list.sort()`). Some sorting algorithms might use $O(\\\\log N)$ or $O(N)$ auxiliary space depending on implementation.\n"
