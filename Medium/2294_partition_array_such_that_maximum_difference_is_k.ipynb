    "To solve the \"Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is K\" problem, the most efficient approach involves sorting the array and then greedily forming subsequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the approach and why it works, followed by code implementations in various languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Analysis and Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to minimize the number of subsequences. Each subsequence must satisfy the condition that the difference between its maximum and minimum elements is at most `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a sorted array `nums`. If we are trying to form a subsequence, it's always optimal to include as many elements as possible into the current subsequence to minimize the total number of subsequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we start a new subsequence with the smallest available element `min_val`. To keep the difference `max_val - min_val <= k`, any subsequent elements we add to this subsequence must be at most `min_val + k`. By picking the smallest available element to start a new subsequence, we maximize our \"budget\" `k` for subsequent elements, allowing us to potentially include more numbers in the current subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This greedy strategy works because sorting ensures that we are always considering elements in increasing order. When we encounter an element that cannot be part of the current subsequence (because `current_element - min_val > k`), it means we must start a new subsequence with this element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sort `nums`**: Sort the input array `nums` in non-decreasing order. This is crucial for the greedy approach to work effectively.\n",
    "2.  **Initialize `subsequences_count`**: Set this to 1, as we will always need at least one subsequence (unless the array is empty).\n",
    "3.  **Initialize `current_min`**: Set `current_min` to `nums[0]` (the smallest element after sorting). This will be the minimum value of our current subsequence.\n",
    "4.  **Iterate through `nums`**: Starting from the second element (`nums[1]`), iterate through the sorted array.\n",
    "    - For each `num` in `nums`:\n",
    "      - Check if `num - current_min > k`.\n",
    "      - If it is, it means `num` cannot be part of the current subsequence. We must start a new subsequence with `num`. Increment `subsequences_count` by 1, and update `current_min` to `num`.\n",
    "      - If `num - current_min <= k`, it means `num` can be part of the current subsequence. We don't need to do anything specific here, as `current_min` remains the minimum of the _current_ subsequence, and we are just extending it.\n",
    "5.  **Return `subsequences_count`**: After iterating through all elements, this will be the minimum number of subsequences required.\n",
    "\n",

    "2.  `subsequences_count = 1`\n",
    "3.  `current_min = 1` (from `nums[0]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Iterate**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `num = 2`: `2 - 1 = 1`. `1 <= k (2)`. Keep `current_min = 1`. Subsequence: `[1, 2]`\n",
    "    - `num = 3`: `3 - 1 = 2`. `2 <= k (2)`. Keep `current_min = 1`. Subsequence: `[1, 2, 3]`\n",
    "    - `num = 5`: `5 - 1 = 4`. `4 > k (2)`.\n",
    "      - Start new subsequence: `subsequences_count = 2`.\n",

    "You've asked for \"all possible approaches to solve this problem with code please,\" and I've already provided the most efficient and practical one (Greedy with Sorting) with code in Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript in my previous detailed answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate and ensure I'm meeting your request fully, here's that **optimal and recommended approach with code again**, as it's the only one that is feasible and commonly used for this problem. As explained, other approaches like brute force are computationally prohibitive, and Dynamic Programming, while technically possible to frame, essentially boils down to the same greedy logic for this specific problem after sorting, without offering any performance advantage.\n",

    "### Optimal Approach: Greedy with Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard and most efficient way to solve this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sort the array `nums`**: This is the crucial first step. It allows us to efficiently determine which elements can be grouped together.\n",
    "2.  **Initialize `subsequences_count = 1`**: We'll always need at least one subsequence if the array is not empty.\n",
    "3.  **Initialize `current_min = nums[0]`**: The first element of the sorted array will be the minimum value of our initial subsequence.\n",
    "4.  **Iterate through `nums` from the second element**:\n",
    "    - For each `num` in the array:\n",
    "      - If `num - current_min > k`, it means `num` is too large to be included in the current subsequence (its difference from `current_min` exceeds `k`). Therefore, we must start a new subsequence with `num`.\n",
    "      - Increment `subsequences_count` and update `current_min = num`.\n",
    "5.  **Return `subsequences_count`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it works (Intuition):** By sorting, we ensure that when we decide to start a new subsequence, we pick the smallest available element. This choice maximizes the \"room\" for subsequent elements to be included (up to `current_min + k`), thus minimizing the number of times we have to break off and start a new subsequence.\n",
