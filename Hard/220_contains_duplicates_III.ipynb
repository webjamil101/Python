    "## Approaches to Solve \"Contains Duplicate III\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem typically requires more sophisticated data structures than a simple hash set. The most common and efficient approaches involve either a **sliding window with a sorted data structure** (like a Balanced Binary Search Tree or `SortedList` in Python) or a **bucket sort/hashing approach**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1\\. Using a Sliding Window with a Balanced Binary Search Tree (or `SortedList`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most general and robust approach. We maintain a window of size `indexDiff` of elements, but instead of a simple hash set, we use a data structure that can efficiently perform range queries (find elements within `valueDiff` of a target) and also support efficient insertion/deletion. A Balanced Binary Search Tree (BBST) like an AVL tree or Red-Black tree is ideal. In Python, we don't have a native BBST. We can use a third-party library like `sortedcontainers.SortedList`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Initialize an empty `SortedList` (or a BBST if implemented manually). This list will store numbers within our current `indexDiff` window.\n",
    "2.  Iterate through `nums` with index `i` and value `num`.\n",
    "3.  **Maintain Window Size:** If `i > indexDiff`, remove `nums[i - indexDiff - 1]` from the `SortedList`. This ensures that the list only contains elements whose indices are within `indexDiff` of the current `i`.\n",
    "4.  **Check `valueDiff`:**\n",
    "    - Use `SortedList`'s `bisect_left` (or equivalent in a BBST) to find the insertion point for `num - valueDiff`. Let this be `idx_low`.\n",
    "    - Use `SortedList`'s `bisect_right` (or equivalent) to find the insertion point for `num + valueDiff`. Let this be `idx_high`.\n",
    "    - Check if any element exists in the `SortedList` between `idx_low` and `idx_high` (exclusive of `idx_high`). Specifically, if `idx_low < len(sorted_list)` and `abs(sorted_list[idx_low] - num) <= valueDiff`, then we found a pair. Return `True`.\n",
    "    - More precisely, we need to check the element at `idx_low`. If `sorted_list[idx_low]` exists and `sorted_list[idx_low] <= num + valueDiff`, it implies that `num - valueDiff <= sorted_list[idx_low] <= num + valueDiff`.\n",
    "5.  **Add Current Element:** Add `num` to the `SortedList`.\n",
    "6.  If the loop completes without finding such a pair, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",

    "3.  Initialize an empty dictionary `buckets` to store `bucket_id -> number` (or `bucket_id -> index` if you prefer, though the value itself is sufficient to check `valueDiff`).\n",
    "4.  Iterate through `nums` with index `i` and value `num`.\n",
    "5.  **Maintain Window Size:** If `i > indexDiff`, remove the element `nums[i - indexDiff - 1]` from its corresponding bucket in `buckets`. This prevents checking elements outside the `indexDiff` window. You'll need to know which bucket `nums[i - indexDiff - 1]` belonged to.\n",
    "6.  **Check Buckets:**\n",
    "    - Calculate `current_bucket_id = get_bucket_id(num)`.\n",
    "    - Check if `current_bucket_id` exists in `buckets`. If it does, a duplicate exists within `valueDiff` (since all numbers in this bucket satisfy `abs(x-y) <= valueDiff`). Return `True`.\n",
    "    - Check `current_bucket_id - 1` (left adjacent bucket). If it exists in `buckets` and `abs(buckets[current_bucket_id - 1] - num) <= valueDiff`, return `True`.\n",
    "    - Check `current_bucket_id + 1` (right adjacent bucket). If it exists in `buckets` and `abs(buckets[current_bucket_id + 1] - num) <= valueDiff`, return `True`.\n",
    "7.  **Add to Bucket:** Add `num` to `buckets[current_bucket_id]`.\n",

    "**Important Note on Bucketing:** The `get_bucket_id` function for negative numbers needs careful implementation to ensure numbers are grouped correctly. The `val // bucket_size` works for positive numbers, but for negative numbers, Python's floor division can put numbers in unexpected buckets relative to the positive range. A common pattern is `(val - min_val) // bucket_size` after shifting all numbers to be non-negative, or a direct handling as shown in the commented Python code for negative numbers. The provided `(val + 1) // bucket_size - 1` handles it correctly.\n",
