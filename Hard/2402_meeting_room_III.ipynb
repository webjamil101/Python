    "You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the **half-closed** time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are **unique**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1.Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the **lowest** number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2.If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the **same** duration as the original meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3.When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original **start** time should be given the room.\n",
    "  Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the **lowest** number.\n",
