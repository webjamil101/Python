    "A balanced permutation requires the sum of digits at odd indices to equal the sum of digits at even indices. If the total sum of digits in `num` (let it be `tot`) is odd, no balanced permutation is possible, so we return 0. Otherwise, the sum of digits at odd positions and even positions must both be `tot / 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that `num` can contain repeated digits, the total number of distinct permutations is given by the multiset permutation formula:\n",
    "$$S = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{i=0}^{9} cnt[i]!}$$\n",
    "where $n$ is the length of `num`, and $cnt[i]$ is the count of digit $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $m = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$ be the number of odd positions and $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ be the number of even positions. We aim to find the number of permutations where the sum of digits at odd positions equals the sum at even positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider placing digits 0 to 9 sequentially. For each digit $i$, let $k_i$ be the number of times it appears in odd positions. Then it appears $cnt[i] - k_i$ times in even positions. The number of ways to place these is:\n",
    "$$T_i = \\binom{k_i}{m - \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} k_j} \\times \\binom{cnt[i] - k_i}{n - m - \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} (cnt[j] - k_j)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of arrangements for a valid configuration $(k_0, \\dots, k_9)$ is the product of these terms for all digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use memoized search to efficiently compute this. Let `dfs(i, curr, oddCnt)` be the number of valid ways to fill digits from $i$ to 9, with `oddCnt` remaining odd positions and a target sum `curr` for those positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive formula is:\n",
    "$$dfs(i, curr, oddCnt) = \\sum_{j=0}^{cnt[i]} \\binom{j}{oddCnt} \\times \\binom{cnt[i] - j}{\\sum_{k=i}^{9} cnt[k] - oddCnt} \\times dfs(i+1, curr - j \\cdot i, oddCnt - j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The base case is when $i = 10$. If `curr == 0` and `oddCnt == 0`, return 1; otherwise, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pruning conditions: For a valid $k_i$ (number of digit $i$ in odd positions):\n",
    "$$cnt[i] - (\\sum_{j=i}^{9} cnt[j] - oddCnt) \\le k_i \\le \\min(cnt[i], oddCnt)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use dynamic programming. Let $f[i][curr][oddCnt]$ be the number of ways to allocate digits from 0 to $i$ such that `oddCnt` digits have been placed in odd positions and their sum is `curr`. The number of digits allocated to even positions is then $\\sum_{k=0}^{i} cnt[k] - oddCnt$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we allocate digit $i$ $j$ times to odd positions and $cnt[i] - j$ times to even positions, the number of ways to do this is $\\binom{j}{oddCnt} \\times \\binom{cnt[i] - j}{\\sum_{k=0}^{i} cnt[k] - oddCnt}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DP transition is:\n",
    "$$f[i][curr][oddCnt] = \\sum_{j=0}^{cnt[i]} \\binom{j}{oddCnt} \\times \\binom{cnt[i] - j}{\\sum_{k=0}^{i} cnt[k] - oddCnt} \\times f[i-1][curr - j \\cdot i][oddCnt - j]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The base case is $f[0][0][0] = 1$. The final answer is $f[9][tot / 2][\\lceil n/2 \\rceil]$.\n",
