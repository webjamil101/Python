    "# 2561. Rearranging Fruits\n",

    "\n",
    "You have two fruit baskets containing n fruits each. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays basket1 and basket2 representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets equal. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:\n",

    "- Choose two indices i and j, and swap the ith fruit of basket1 with the jth fruit of basket2.\n",

    "# **Study on Sampling and Reconstruction Experiment**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To understand the concept of sampling and reconstruction of continuous-time signals.\n",
    "2. To examine the effects of different sampling rates on signal reconstruction.\n",
    "3. To verify the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.\n",
    "4. To analyze the distortions caused by undersampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling is the process of converting a continuous-time signal into a discrete-time signal by measuring its amplitude at regular intervals. Reconstruction is the reverse process, where the original continuous signal is approximated from its sampled data. According to the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, a signal must be sampled at a rate at least twice its highest frequency component to avoid aliasing and ensure accurate reconstruction. This experiment demonstrates the principles of sampling and reconstruction using different sampling rates and analyzes the effects of proper and improper sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "A continuous-time signal \\( x(t) \\) is sampled at intervals \\( T_s \\) (sampling period) to produce a discrete-time signal \\( x[n] = x(nT_s) \\). The sampling frequency \\( f_s \\) is given by:  \n",
    "\\[ f_s = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a band-limited signal with maximum frequency \\( f*{max} \\), the minimum sampling rate required for perfect reconstruction is:  \n",
    "\\[ f_s \\geq 2f*{max} \\]  \n",
    "If \\( f*s < 2f*{max} \\), aliasing occurs, causing distortion in the reconstructed signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reconstruction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampled signal is reconstructed using an interpolation method (e.g., zero-order hold or ideal low-pass filtering) to recover the original continuous signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Experiment Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A signal generator was used to produce a sinusoidal waveform.\n",
    "2. The signal was sampled at different rates (above, at, and below the Nyquist rate).\n",
    "3. The sampled data was reconstructed using an interpolation technique.\n",
    "4. The original and reconstructed signals were compared using an oscilloscope or simulation software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Result Analysis and Discussion**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sampling Above Nyquist Rate (\\( f*s > 2f*{max} \\))**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The reconstructed signal was observed to closely match the original signal.\n",
    "   - Minimal distortion was noticed, confirming the validity of the sampling theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sampling at Nyquist Rate (\\( f*s = 2f*{max} \\))**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The reconstructed signal retained the original shape but exhibited slight imperfections.\n",
    "   - It was concluded that sampling at exactly the Nyquist rate is theoretically sufficient but may lead to practical limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sampling Below Nyquist Rate (\\( f*s < 2f*{max} \\))**\n",
    "   - Severe distortion (aliasing) was observed in the reconstructed signal.\n",
    "   - High-frequency components were misrepresented as lower frequencies, demonstrating the consequences of undersampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment successfully demonstrated the principles of sampling and reconstruction. It was verified that the Nyquist-Shannon theorem must be followed to avoid aliasing. The effects of different sampling rates were analyzed, and it was concluded that a sampling rate higher than the Nyquist rate is necessary for accurate signal reconstruction. The importance of proper sampling in digital signal processing applications was emphasized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "        1.  Count the frequency of each fruit in both baskets. We use a single\n",
    "            dictionary (or a collections.Counter) to track the net change.\n",
    "            - Fruits from `basket1` increment the count.\n",
    "            - Fruits from `basket2` decrement the count.\n",
    "            Simultaneously, find the minimum fruit value (`minEl`) across both baskets.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2.  Check for feasibility: Iterate through the final frequency map.\n",
    "            - If any fruit's count is odd, it's impossible to balance the baskets,\n",

    "              the count of two different fruit types, keeping the parity of all counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3.  Identify fruits to be swapped: Create a list `fruits_to_swap`.\n",
    "            - For each fruit with a non-zero count `c` in the map, it means there are\n",
    "              `abs(c)` fruits of this type that need to be moved.\n",

    "                   The cost is the value of the fruit itself (as one of the two being swapped).\n",
    "                b) Swapping it with the globally minimum fruit (`minEl`) as an intermediary,\n",
    "                   which costs `2 * minEl`.\n",
