    "You are also given an integer startPos and an integer k. Initially, you are at the position startPos. From any position, you can either walk to the left or right. It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis, and you can walk at most k steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.\n",

    "Aug 01, 2025\n",
    "Editorial\n",
    "Approach 1: Binary Search\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "Since the fruit positions are already sorted in ascending order, we can efficiently determine how many fruits fall within any interval on the x-axis using binary search. The main challenge is to find the interval of positions that can be reached from startPos using at most k steps, such that the total number of fruits collected is maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow a greedy strategy, moving in one direction first and then turning around. This works because fruits can only be picked once, and covering a wider range increases the chance of collecting more fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main movement patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Move x steps in one direction, then k−x steps in the opposite direction.\n",
    "When x=0, we simply move in one direction for k steps.\n",
    "For each x in the range [0,⌊\n",
    "2\n",
    "k\n",
    "​\n",
    "⌋], we consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "Left-first movement: move left x steps, then right (k−x) steps. This covers the interval [startPos−x,startPos+k−2x].\n",
    "Right-first movement: move right x steps, then left (k−x) steps. This covers the interval [startPos−(k−2x),startPos+x].\n",
    "For each of these intervals, we compute the number of fruits using prefix sums and binary search in O(logn) time. The maximum value across all such intervals gives the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "Let n be the length of the array fruits, and let k be the given integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity: O(n+klogn).\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity for calculating the prefix sum of the array is O(n), and the time required for each query to find the number of fruits in a range is O(logn). Since there are a total of k queries, the overall time complexity is O(n+klogn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity: O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate and store the prefix sum of the array, which requires O(n) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach 2: Sliding Window\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "We can approach the problem from a new perspective. Suppose we fix an interval [left,right] (where left and right are indices in the fruits array). From the given starting position startPos, how many steps are required to visit all fruit positions within this interval?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three cases to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1: startPos > fruits[right][0]\n",
    "The interval lies entirely to the left of startPos. We need to move left to reach fruits[left][0].\n",
    "Steps needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "startPos−fruits[left][0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2: startPos < fruits[left][0]\n",
    "The interval lies entirely to the right of startPos. We need to move right to reach fruits[right][0].\n",
    "Steps needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits[right][0]−startPos\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 3: startPos is within the interval\n",
    "There are two ways to visit both ends:\n",
    "\n",
    "Go left first to fruits[left][0], then right to fruits[right][0]\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "startPos−fruits[left][0]+fruits[right][0]−fruits[left][0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Go right first to fruits[right][0], then left to fruits[left][0]\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits[right][0]−startPos+fruits[right][0]−fruits[left][0]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in general, the minimum number of steps required to traverse the interval [fruits[left][0],fruits[right][0]] is:\n",
    "\n",
    "step(left,right)=fruits[right][0]−fruits[left][0]+min(∣startPos−fruits[left][0]∣, ∣startPos−fruits[right][0]∣)\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression ensures that we count both the total distance and the shorter leg from startPos to either end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we fix right and slide left, we observe:\n",
    "\n",
    "If fruits[left][0] < startPos, decreasing left can decrease the step value.\n",
    "If fruits[left][0] ≥ startPos, decreasing left no longer helps and step stays the same or increases.\n",
    "Thus, for fixed right, the step(left, right) function is non-increasing as long as fruits[left][0] < startPos, and non-decreasing afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we use a sliding window where both left and right are pointers to intervals in the fruits array. As we move right forward to include more fruits, we check whether the number of steps needed to reach the interval exceeds k. If it does, we increment left to shrink the window until the constraint is satisfied. At each step, we track the sum of fruits in the valid window and update the maximum found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "Let n be the length of the array fruits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity: O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time, we move the right endpoint of the fixed window and then try to move the left endpoint. The right endpoint can move at most n times, and the left endpoint can also move at most n times. Therefore, the time complexity is O(2n)=O(n).\n",
    "\n",
