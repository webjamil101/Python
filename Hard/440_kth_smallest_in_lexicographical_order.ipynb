The constraints are significant: $1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^9$. This large value of $n$ means that we cannot generate all numbers and sort them (as that would be $O(n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, too slow for $10^9$).

    "In the \"go right\" step (`current_num += 1`), `current_num` changes its last digit. The `get_count_optimized` function also runs in `O(log10(n))` time because its `while` loop runs for each digit position.\n",
    "Since `k` can be up to `n`, but we are decrementing `k` by the size of subtrees (which can be large) or by 1 (when going down a level), the total number of operations is effectively `O(log K * log N)` or more precisely `O(log^2 N)` in the worst case (if `k` forces many right moves or `n` is very large). Given $N=10^9$, $\\log_{10}N \\approx 9$. So, $O(9^2)$ is roughly $O(81)$ operations per loop iteration, and the loop runs $O(\\log N)$ times. Total time complexity is `O(log^2 N)`. This is very efficient for $N=10^9$.\n",
